            <h3>September 14th, 2017</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Back at the beginning of August my long-suffering wife and I packed
up our possessions and moved almost 2 hours away to a small village
of ~2500 people into a house on a street that doesn't seem to show
up on a lot of major GPS systems. Luckily it shows up both on Apple
and Google maps, and there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hortons">Tim Hortons</a>
close by to act as a known landmark and guide people in.</p>

<p>With the move came an opportunity to Do Something Different with the
home wireless setup. In the past, I used a good, consumer-grade home
wireless router and it was usually good enough. Sometimes my oldest
daughter (her room was the furthest away from the wifi router) would
complain about poor signal, so I bought some <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/network-extenders/range-extenders">wifi extenders</a>
and those did the trick.</p>

<p>So this sort of thing was great...but I felt like I was not prepared
for the near-future, which is a home filled with all sorts of devices
that will connect via wifi to do things. I got a <a href="https://nest.com/thermostats/nest-learning-thermostat/overview/">Nest thermostat</a> and was going to have an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y6FSV5Q/?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAAMEe">awesome TV</a> that needed a network connection. I also would have an older <a href="https://www.roku.com">Roku</a>
device that would want to be on the network. Not to mention my own
devices for work...and my wife's iPad and iPhone...and devices my
kids were going to be using.</p>

<p>In short, I wanted to future-proof my network somewhat and try and
anticipate an explosion of devices that would need to be connected
to it. Yes, I am aware of some security implications and I am going
to be working on minimizing the exposure these things will have to
my network.</p>

<p>At some point I came across Troy Hunt's great blog post explaining
how he <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/wiring-a-home-network-from-the-ground-up-with-ubiquiti/">helped wire his brother's home</a>
with some great networking hardware. I clearly am not re-inventing
the wheel here -- Troy's template is one that I would absolutely
follow...if you have the ability to run wires in your home.</p>

<p>In my case, it was not going to be a problem. The previous owner had
been using VoIP for their phones so there were already several wired
connections backed by cat5. I was going to need some other lines run
throughout the house but it was not going to be an issue.</p>

<p>So I ended up with most of the hardware Troy recommended in his blog
post:</p>

<ul>
<li>7 in-wall 802.11ac access points throughout the house</li>
<li>1 24-port Power-over-ethernet switch</li>
<li>1 security gateway device that I am slowly learning how to configure correctly</li>
<li>4 cat5 connections for the access points</li>
<li>3 cat6 connections for the other access points</li>
<li>6u server cabinet (helpfully mounted on the wall) for all the equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>I kept my existing <a href="https://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/R6400.aspx">wifi router</a>,
converted it to an access point, and plugged
it into the switch because my youngest's Netbook refused to connect to the new hardware.</p>

<p>But why go to all this trouble and expense (it cost me CDN$2k for hardware and another CDN$1.5k for the cabling work) for
my home network? Flexibility. This setup will be great for as long as gigabit
ethernet remains faster than anything I can get at my home. Right now our
<a href="http://quadro.net">local internet provider</a> provides me with 50Mbps down / 5 Mbps
up over coax -- the modem is mounted on the wall next to the cabinet.
At some point they will be upgrading connections around here -- less than 1km 
away they are building a brand new subdivision with gigabit fiber being run to
homes. When the time comes, I'll just have to update the modem...and nothing
else. Maybe at some point <a href="https://www.ubnt.com">Ubiquiti</a> releases some nicer in-room access points.
I can just swap my old ones for the new ones and everything else will just still
work great.</p>

<p>Each room has an access point now that covers a small area. The equipment smoothly
handles transitions from one location to another, and I can get to see some
cool reports about who is doing what (how much is my youngest watching YouTube?!?)
and adding and removing hardware for this setup is easy.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this type of setup for your home:</p>

<ul>
<li>centralized location of a switch near where your modem / internet connection enters</li>
<li>wired connections to multiple locations, terminating near the switch</li>
<li>in-wall or very small, unobtrusive access points</li>
</ul>

<p>I realize not everyone can do this -- apartments and older homes make this very
impractical. I would recommend looking into mesh networks (Ubiquiti's consumer
line of Amplifi look really good) to give yourself sufficient capacity. The
number of network-aware or even network-required devices is only to go up, not down. If you can get out in
front of it a little bit you'll be in a great spot to take advantage of it.</p>
