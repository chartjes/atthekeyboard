            <p>It was one year ago today that I released <a href="http://grumpy-testing.com">"The Grumpy Programmer's Guide To Building Testable PHP Applications"</a>. 650+ customers later (about 10% of those are free copies) 
I am happy with some of the outcomes, and unhappy about others.</p>

<p>Just for the sake of openness, here's an awesome ASCII bar graph made with
<a href="https://github.com/stefanschramm/barg">barg</a> to show you week-by-week sales
counts and numbers. I apologize for the scrolling you might have to do to see it.</p>

<p>What am I disappointed about? I think, to use the old expression, I left a lot
of money on the table. I could've charged more for the book, but this was
before I started learning more about the marketing of info products and
how to do research to find solutions to problems people are experiencing.</p>

<p>Setting that aside, I think my Testing Crusade is paying dividends for the
community as a whole. The more developers who are exposed to the ideas
that people like myself are promoting, the higher quality code that
is likely to be produced.</p>

<p>If you're a customer of mine, thanks so much for supporting my efforts through
your paid contributions. Writing automated tests and code that you can easily test doesn't have to suck.
I can show you how to do it, and I look forward to bringing you more of it
in 2013.</p>

           <h3>January 7th, 2013</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Every once in a while I come across a blog post or a presentation that helps
me figure out something that has been bothering but I was having problems
articulating. Lately I've been struggling to come up with strategies to help
developers figure out when they should REALLY be writing tests for their code.</p>

<p>If you believe in the power of TDD, then the answer is "you write tests from
the beginning of the project and forever after." I am a believer that TDD can
be a very powerful design tool for building things at the unit / module / component
level.</p>

<p>Then some people asked me my thoughts on the comments by the creator of the
Rails project about the usefulness of dependency injection. As happens when
I am feeling frustrated, I started firing out the tweets on my feelings on
testing and the lonely Crusade that I am on.</p>

<p>Then I saw a talk by Dan North called <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Decisions-Decisions">"Decisions, Decisions"</a> at the recommendation of <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbarber">Ian Barber</a> that made me realize that someone else has articulated my feelings on
when you should be doing testing. Slides for the presentation can be found
<a href="http://qconlondon.com/dl/qcon-london-2012/slides/DanNorth_DecisionsDecisions.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>You should watch the whole presentation. So many decisions about programming
are made without understanding, REALLY understanding the trade-offs involved
when making one decision vs. another.</p>

<p>Let's look at TDD vs. Test whenever. The trade-off being made here is not
about quality of code or guarding against regressions. It's about opportunity cost.
This had occurred to me but I had dismissed it as being "anti-testing".</p>

<p>But I think I was wrong, and here's why.</p>

<p>In that awesome presentation he talks about "patterns" he observed on the team
he was working with at the time. He was amazed at how much work this team was
getting done, so he spent time analyzing what they were doing and trying to
turn some of their activities into patterns of behaviour. Repeatable processes
are good, right?</p>

<p>The one that he saw being related to writing was a pattern he called "Spike
and Stabilize." Basically, you write code without any tests until it becomes
a solid part of your application's architecture. Once this code has proven
it's usefulness, you start writing comprehensive tests in order to verify
that it is in fact doing the job and doesn't break going forward.</p>

<p>This is so obvious to me now. Clearly, you are leaving yourself open to the
potential of writing not just application code but testing code that gets
tossed away if the idea you are implementing is unable to prove it's value.</p>

<p>Opportunity cost is huge and often dismissed by developers too. If you have
some prototype code, or even functionality with a half-life measured
in 3-month-increments, what else could be worked on while tests for this
code are being written?</p>

<p>Could this hybrid approach be an easier sell to skeptical managers or
other stakeholders? That's hard to say. The "too busy to write tests"
camp still has many members, and is still seems that it takes catastrophic
failures before many people join the Testing Crusade.</p>

<p>To be perfectly clear: I find great value in prototyping code and then
committing to tests once the prototype is ready to move to a more stable
environment.</p>

<p>I try and do prototyping before I commit to writing code, because I often
feel that way. My prototypes are usually command-line scripts that try
and accomplish the task I've been assigned. That way, it's easier to
actually write some tests once I know what I'm doing and guard against
regressions later.</p>

<p>The key to all this is being able to identify at what stage in this particular
pattern your code is at. Is it still a spike, meaning you are working out
implementation details and trying to figure out if it will even have the
desired result? Or is it stable, providing solid value to the application 
as a whole and ready to be wrapped in tests to protect against regressions?</p>

<p>Next time you are thinking about "I need some tests for this", consider the
Spike and Stabilize pattern. The answer might be "you need tests...but not yet."</p>

            <p>2012 was a very interesting year for me. It started with me being tired
and unhappy...and this year ended with me being tired and unhappy. For
different reasons, though.</p>

<p>I had a much different blog post written, and decided to scrap it in favour
of a different approach. Buckle up, here we go, starting with January and 
continuing to the end of the year:</p>

<ul>
<li>unhappy with start-up life</li>
<li>started grinding out episodes of a <a href="http://devhell.info">podcast</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/funkatron">Ed</a></li>
<li>released my <a href="http://grumpy-testing.com">"write testable PHP applications" book</a> on January 11th</li>
<li>spoke to a near-empty room at CodeMash 2012, they seem to not like PHP there</li>
<li>started working for an online learning company</li>
<li>made plans to attend <a href="http://tek12.phparch.com">PHP|Tek 2012</a></li>
<li>found softball enjoyable this year as I could actually bend over to field balls. Still can't hit</li>
<li>did a live episode of the podcast at PHP|Tek, which was awesome</li>
<li>started mentoring three developers on ways of being grumpy programmers</li>
<li>found the benefits of test-centric development to be ruined by a terrible work environment</li>
<li>Ed and I hit our groove with the podcast in the summer</li>
<li>started looking for another job</li>
<li>taught my PHP testing bootcamp course of the first time, in person though</li>
<li>switched to my third job in 2012</li>
<li>got accepted to speak at a conference in Sweden</li>
<li>helped organize a <a href="http://truenorthphp.ca">PHP conference</a> up here in Kanuckistan</li>
<li>spoke to a near-empty room at the conference in Sweden, guess they don't like PHP there either</li>
<li>got accepted to speak at a PHP conference in Belgium</li>
<li>created an online version of my PHP testing bootcamp course</li>
<li>worked on my <a href="http://grumpy-phpunit.com">next book</a></li>
<li>wondered what the hell happened to everything I wanted to do in 2012.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like so many things in life, you can only plan for so much. At the beginning of
2012 the only thing I knew for sure was (a) I wasn't liking my job and (b) my
book was coming out extremely soon. At the same time I was worrying about the
fact that my ENTIRE FUCKING CAREER is basically built upon the pile of web-enabled
spaghetti that is PHP. What the hell should I do?</p>

<p>So I took some babysteps towards learning server-side Javascript and played around
with Node.js. I like it, I think I am understanding how to build applications using 
it in a more idiomatic way.</p>

<p>But there is still lots of PHP. Can't escape it, it's all I know. Well, that and
a whole bunch of actual theory on how to build web applications as small modules
of code that talk to each other.</p>

<p>I didn't set any goals for 2012 other than "sell $10K worth of books" and I did
manage to almost accomplish that. $6,547.25 in royalties for the ebook, $2K
in licensing fees and some-amount-I-have-not-added-up in paper copies of the book.
I think I can say that I <em>almost</em> made it, and that my next book will do
even better because of the success of the first one.</p>

<p>So what is in store for me in 2013? The plan is to keep pushing the info-products
(books, courses, screencasts later in the year) while continuing to make solid
contributions at the day job. There is no lack of interesting things for me
to do at the day job, more than enough to keep the gears going.</p>

<p>I enter 2013 feeling like I'm stuck in low gear mentally, though. I've clearly
over-committed myself and I just have to grind through it until March 2013.</p>

<p>I will say that I have decided to focus on becoming a better programmer, no
matter what languages I tackle. I have a bunch of reading material cued up 
to help me get better at taking real-world problems and figuring out how
to solve them in the context of programming environments and domain models.</p>

<p>That is the last piece that I personally feel is missing from my skill set:
learning how to figure out how to turn business objectives into techincal
solutions. I'm in a good spot to do it, and I know my <a href="https://twitter.com/PolarLava">boss</a>
has all sorts of "fun" things lined up for me to do.</p>

<p>So thanks for another year of watching what I do with some interest and I aim
to provide you with more entertainment and knowledge throughout 2013.</p>
