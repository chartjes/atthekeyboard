            <p>Thanks to Joel Moss for pointing out that there is a problem with my RSS feeds.  I'm trying to figure it out, hopefully it's nothing serious.</p>

            <h2><a href="/2007/07/03/what-do-you-do-when-there-is-no-documentation/">What Do You Do When There Is No Documentation?</a></h2>
           <h3>July 3rd, 2007</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>One of the most common complaints currently leveled at the CakePHP project is that "there is no documentation for version 1.2".  What people really mean is that there is no one central place where people who want to use the latest version can find documentation.  There are examples in <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org">the bakery</a> and in threads on the mailing list.  Really gutsy developers can look at the <a href="http://api.cakephp.org/1.2/">API for version 1.2</a> or dive into the source themselves.</p>

<p>
Now, a decision was made that there would be no manual released for 1.2 until 1.2 is declared stable (or maybe the API's won't change).  Luckily you can look at an <a href="https://cakeforge.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/*checkout*/sandbox/1.2/1point2.pdf?rev=155&root=cakedocs">alpha version</a> of the documentation as well.  I suspect that not too many people know that you can find this information and simply assume that there is none available.
</p>

<p>
So, what *do* you do when there is little or no documentation?  I'm running into this because I'm trying to use a brand-new component for authorization and access control called (oddly enough) Auth.  It's very useful...but there is no documentation existing for it.  I have access to a soon-to-be-published article about it (thanks Nate!) but it's not giving me enough to go on.  I'm left to call in other favours and get access to the source code of some other apps to see how they are using the Auth component, but some of those examples aren't working for me.  *sigh*.
</p>

<p>
So, I ask you, lazyweb style, how do YOU deal with a lack of documentation for a programming component that you want to use?</p>

           <h3>June 26th, 2007</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Since I was moaning to Larry about the lack of tests in CakePHP (even though there is a great test suite based on Simpletest) I felt obliged to add in some tests to my work on adding functionality to the Email component to allow it to send things via SMTP.</p>

<p>Using the test suite is actually quite easy:  drop <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">SimpleTest</a> into your cake/vendors directly and you're ready to start writing your tests.  Having written tests using SimpleTest before it wasn't going to be too hard for me to get them done.  But there was one little problem:  how do you test a component?</p>

<p>
Components are called via controllers, so there was no way for me to simply instantiate the component and test it out.  After much back-and-forth with Larry (aka PhpNut) via IM I got it working.
<br />
~~~
require_once LIBS . '/controller/components/email.php';

class EmailTestController extends Controller {
    var $name = 'EmailTest';
    var $uses = null;
    var $components = array('Email');
}

class EmailTest extends CakeTestCase {
    var $name = 'Email';

    function setUp() {
        $this->Controller =& new EmailTestController();

        restore_error_handler();
        @$this->Controller->_initComponents();
        set_error_handler('simpleTestErrorHandler');

        $this->Controller->Email->startup($this->Controller);
        ClassRegistry::addObject('view', new View($this->Controller));
    }

    function testSmtpSend() {
        $this->Controller->Email->to = 'chartjes@localhost';
        $this->Controller->Email->subject = 'Cake SMTP test';
        $this->Controller->Email->replyTo = 'noreply@example.com';
        $this->Controller->Email->from = 'noreply@example.com';
        $this->Controller->Email->delivery = 'smtp';
        $this->Controller->Email->template = null;
        $this->assertTrue($this->Controller->Email->send("This is the body of the message"));
    }

}
?>
~~~
</p>

<p>
The trick ended up being me not knowing to create an instantiation of the controller and then telling it to initialize all components.  Before I was doig that I woudl get all sorts of controller-related errors.  The internals of CakePHP are slowly being revealed to me, which is a good thing because working for <a href="http://www.cakedevelopment.com">CDC</a> pretty much guarantees I will need to understand them inside and out.
</p>

<p>
I know that testing isn't very glamourous but can you imagine how to debug an Email compnent that sends out email on a specific TCP port without a repeatable unit test?  Me neither.
