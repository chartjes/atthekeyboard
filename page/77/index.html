           <h3>October 20th, 2008</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>(Note: I have updated this posting with some more info on what I am looking for)</p>

<p>
Since I make a little bit of money every month in advertising off this blog, I thought I'd put some of this money to good use.  I've been trying very hard to use <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> as my editor for day-to-day use.  Previously, amidst lots of waffling, I had settled on TextMate for my day-to-day work.  Awesome editor, nice and lightweight and full of the cool features I needed.  There were two features that were stopping me from totally switching over.
</p>

<p>
First one was Cmd-T inside a project, which allows you to search through your project doing a fuzzy search for files that match your search string.  Awesome, awesome feature.  Cuts down on the browsing using the project drawer that I tended to do.  That particular hurdle has been fixed thanks to <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org">Jamis Buck</a> (of Capistrano and 37 Signals) through his <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/10/10/coming-home-to-vim">FuzzyFinderTextmate</a> plugin.  It's extends the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1984">fuzzyfinder.vim</a> plugin with a little bit of Ruby.  Does the trick, but you have to do a little jiggering to get it to recognize new files. An argument for another day I guess.
</p>

<p>
The second one is the also-awesome 'Find In Project' feature in Textmate, which searches through all your files looking for matches for the string (or regex if you're up to it) inside those files, then providing you with a list of files that you can open.  I'm wanting functionality similar to how the fuzzyfindertextmate plugin referenced above works, but for searching inside files.
</p>

<p>I am aware of how :vimgrep and :grep work (thanks to those who pointed it out), but I do not like how the quickfix window works, as I want a dropdown list of the files that contain what was found so I can open them.  Again, very similar as to how the FuzzyFinderTextmate plugin works.
</p>

<p>
So, I am offering $100 of my own ill-gotten advertising revenue (payable via PayPal) to the person who comes up with the solution I like the best that actually works.  If you don't want the money, I can donate it to the charity of your choice as long as they will take PayPal as well.
</p>

<p>
I know *someone* out there can figure this out.  I'll give you until American Thanksgiving to come up with a solution.  Please post your suggestions in the comments, but please realize that all comments are moderated and off-topic ones will definitely be sent to /dev/null

Do you like sports?  Are you good with PHP/CSS/HTML/MySQL?  Not scared of XML?  Can you handle working remotely from the comfort of your home or a never-ending series of coffee shops with free wifi?  If so, there is an opportunity for you.
</p>

<p>
My employer, <a href="http://www.xmlteam.com">XML Team Solutions</a> is looking to hire a "Software Engineer" to replace an outgoing employee.  This is not an entry-level position as it requires solid skills in PHP, HTML/CSS/ and knowing how to build some pretty scary SQL queries.
</p>

<p>
You would be spending your days hanging out on the company IRC channel, doing tasks as assigned which include writing web apps for internal and external use, answering support tickets from our clients and tackling some interesting problems involving large data sets and traffic levels.  
</p>

<p>XML Team Solutions provides sports data to our clients formatted in XML and offers support tools for dumping that data into a relational database so you could run, for example, a fantasy football site.  We collect data from a wide variety of content sources both in North America and Europe, and we have worked with companies like Yahoo!, Google and ESPN.  If you're into sports, a good problem solver, and used to working with minimal supervision, this is the job for you.  Plus you get to work with me!  What could be better?
</p>

<p>We're a small company (6 people including myself) so you will often be asked to do non-programming tasks because, well, sometimes somebody's got to do it!  I will say that the company feels more like a team than any other place that I've ever worked.
</p>

<p>
If you're interested, send a resume to me at chris@DIESPAMMERREMOVETHISxmlteam.com.  I will only respond to those who are being considered for an interview.  DEFINITELY no recruiters or agencies allowed, thanks.

As a <a href="http://sportso.com">project for work</a> gets ready for an alpha release, I've managed to eliminate all the serious bugs and now have some time for what should've been part of the project from the beginning:  writing tests. As a lapsed tester, I always feel guilty about not writing tests when things start to get complicated with an application.  Whenever you make a change, you have to point-and-click your way through the application to make sure that nothing has broken.  I got tired of pointing-and-clicking, so I decided it was time to shut up and write some tests.  Since I'm using Code Igniter instead of CakePHP for this project (did I mention that I inherited the project and couldn't switch?) I started looking into the culture of testing surrounding Code Igniter.  It's weaker than a newborn baby.
</p>

<p>
The built-in testing system is some weird mishmash of unit testing and "you have to create your own test results template".  WTF?  You can't be serious.  So I quickly ignored that.  Besides, the first set of tests were going to be using <a href="http://phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a> combined with <a href="https://selenium.dev/">Selenium</a> so I could make the "acceptance testing" automated.  As an aside to this, I remember speaking with Sebastian Bergmann (the driving force behind PHPUnit) at a conference maybe 3 years ago and him telling me that he knew someone was working on getting Selenium and PHPUnit to play nicely together.  Anyway, it's working just fine.
</p>

<p>
So, next step was to see if I could use something else than the incredibly lame testing tools that Code Igniter came with.  I found something called <a href="/www.foostack.com/foostack/">fooStack</a>, that contained CIUnit.  It lets you use PHPUnit with Code Igniter.  Now we're talking!  Lickety split I had some unit tests for my models written.  Well, after spending quite a lot of time screwing around with the tests and finding out the difference in relative paths between the application running via Apache and trying to test the models via the command line.  Thanks to all those on Twitter who yelled "use php_sapi_name to figure out what environment you are in, you idiot!" at me.
</p>

<p>
But all this got me to thinking:  how do some other PHP frameworks stack up in terms of having tests?
<ul>
<li>Code Igniter has ZERO tests for the framework itself.  Perhaps I will mention this to my boss next time I'm asked to create a project from scracth.  Hrm, guess I'll have to trust that their code actually works the way it's supposed to.</li>
<li>Zend Framework (full disclosure: I was one of the original authors of the Zend_Service_Audioscrobbler component) has huge amounts of tests for the framework itself.  In fact, any new contributions MUST have working tests submitted with it.</li>
<li>CakePHP has lots of tests for the core, and I believe that I saw something in the changelog for CakePHP 1.2RC3 that indicated they were at 80% code coverage in terms of testing for the CakePHP core.  Bug submissions for CakePHP are supposed to come with tests to prove that there is a repeatable problem.</li>
<li>Symfony recently rewrote it's core tests and created their own testing framework for it.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>So now when you start comparing frameworks to each other, I think it's important you also consider how much effort has gone into creating tests for the core functionality of that framework.  A well tested framework should mean far less surprises when using it.  Given how many tools are out there to assist you in testing, I don't think there are any excuses other than being totally lazy to not create tests for the core functionality of any application.  Pay now, or pay later, but you will PAY to fix bugs in your application.  Paying now is simply cheaper.
</p>

<p>
Would you stake your project on complex code written by someone else that is simply not testable by you?  Perhaps I am not looking at from the proper distance because I am inside the framework-creator culture, but I can't see why you wouldn't want to provide tests to prove your stuff actually works the way you claim it does.  Tests prove that the code is *behaving* the way you expect, and code that is testable is also usually easier to modify as time goes on.  There is some sort of sick joy in making a change to code, running the unit tests, and seeing that you didn't break anything.
