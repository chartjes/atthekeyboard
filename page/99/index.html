        <div>
            <p>
Now, I was going to post something about how I was all pumped up about the whole "I can run my app on Amazon now with EC2, S3 and now SimpleDB!" but I got myself in trouble on a thread on the CakePHP mailing list.  A poster wsa asking something and I looked at the code and said to myself "what the hell is he trying to do here?" so I posted a response that pretty much said that.  I've noticed that these days it's difficult to be an ass on a mailing list because people get all defensive and things like that.  Maybe I should know better, but being an ass comes naturally to me and I don't really worry about people calling me names.
</p>

<p>
I mean, I didn't understand what the poster was trying to do because it was obvious that it wasn't going to work, and I said so, and then he said something, and I said something and away we went!  Classic flamewar, brought on by not having to say those things to someone's face.  Those who know me will tell you that I am pretty much the same in person as I am in my e-mails, so I have no problem saying things directly to people.  But the internet is great for passive-aggressive geeks who lack the intestinal fortitude to say things like that to your face.</p>

<p>
Anyway, the guy got really defensive and flamed me hard.  Of course, I deserve some of that but it reminded me of what I had been feeling for a while now.  Some mailing lists get to the point where I get nothing out of being on the mailing list.  I've cultivated enough friendships through the list that I can hit up those people when I need solutions to stuff (like debugging a problem that I can't figure out with the Auth component in CakePHP despite me promising to contribute a chapter in the documentation about the Auth component).
</p>

<p>
Reading that list frustrates me in the same way that having to tell my two daughters the same things over and over and over and over again.  I don't want to have to repeat myself.  Yes, snarkiness and trolling is an inappropriate response to a lot of questions but damnit, it feels good sometimes to just lower the correctness filter and tell people how you feel!  If that makes me an ass, well, I guess I'm an ass then.  I'm just honest about it compared to a lot of other people.  But then again, isn't that like saying "it's okay to drink so much because I've admitted I'm an alcoholic"?
</p>

<p>
So I think I should either unsubscribe from some of these lists I'm on or simply lurk and not respond to questions.  I mean, if I find myself being a dick more often than I should then I guess it really means that I am the one with the problem and not the "stupid n00bs" (to use the proper derogatory term) who are flailing about trying to get answers to their questions.  
</p>

<p>
I mean what's stupider:  people asking dumb questions or getting all riled up about those questions and feeding my inner bully?  Bah!   Crappy blog indeed.</p>

Many thanks to <a href="http://www.riapedia.com/blog/mike">Mike Potter</a> for sending me a copy of O'Reilly's "Programming Flex 2", which had been on my Amazon Wish List.  It will be some light reading over the Christmas holidays.  Thanks Mike!
</p>

<p>
Now, if I can scrape the money together for a copy of Flex Builder then I can perhaps use a Flex front end for my sporting road-trip planning site...

            <p>
So, dear readers, I received some nice emails and comments from those you have used Zend_Service_Audioscrobbler, along with having a nice email conversation with Wil Sinclair from Zend (who is involved with Zend Framework).  Wil told me that backwards compatibility for the 1.5 version is important so I can't just rip everything up like I want to.  Well, I could but it probably wouldn't be accepted.  I'd have to write some letter to convince the Elder Gods Of Zend Framework of why I needed to break backwards compatibility.  In Wil's words: "?I find it embarrassing and want to destroy the evidence? will not be considered a good enough reason. ".
</p>

<p>
I had a good chuckle at that, but Wil did offer up a very good suggestion on how to go about the refactor that I hadn't thought of:  use a _call() method in the class to intercept all the old calls and translate them into new calls.  I would also get it to trigger a warning that the old method would be deprecated in a future release as a way to get people to upgrade to the newer ones.  Once I have some code, I will show it.  Thanks Wil!
