            <p>I am delivering an "alpha" version of a project for work, a centralized stats reporting system for the various (I believe we are almost up to 40 of them now) forum sites my employer owns.</p>

<p>Having built a few sites with Rails, I found it very easy to build something using the Model-View-Controller pattern.  Although the framework isn't at a 1.0 stable release, the components I am using are stable enough for production use.  There is a component that is in the "incubator" (which is considered unstable and under development) that I would like to use as a helper for the views (it generates URL's based on the controller and action) but I'm trying to avoid the realy unstable code.</p>

<p>When I do the database stuff, that is when I really miss Rail's ActiveRecord database implementation.  The funny thing is that I stumbled across a posting on the <a href=http://phplens.com/phpeverywhere>PHP Everywhere blog</a> (a great web site by a PHP developer who knows what he's doing) where he talked about how he quickly hacked together an ActiveRecord implementation for ADODb (his own DB abstraction layer) based on an early Zend_Db_Model component.  That component isn't in the current code base, which is very weird.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if we'll see that any time soon?  Maybe I'll switch to using ADODb version for the stats reporting system when I get to phase 3 of the project (which is adding pretty graphs to the reports).</p>

            <p>I'm sure my more diligent readers have noticed a lack of posting for two weeks.  I'm back from a vacation with the family in St. Louis (visiting my brother-in-law).  I had a great time, despite the insanely-long 15-hour drive from Canada to St. Louis across the midwest.  I can't imagine doing that trip all the time like some long-haul truckers do.</p>

<p>So anyway, I'm taking some time next week to tweak the outline for my upcoming talk (it's only two months away) at php|works to figure  out where (and more important what they will be) to put the coding examples designed to illustrate ideas from Rails and how they could apply to PHP.</p>

<p>My buddy <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> is enthused about his new job.  I winced a bit when I saw him burning some bridges at his old work with his comments, but given the way he had been treated since I left the company I'm not surprised by it.  Welcome back to the world of actually creating things, Derek. :)</p>

<p>I've been working on a stats reporting system at work with the Zend Framework and it's been going well.  I'm right on schedule and expect to deliver a beta version for testing and comments by Wednesday of next week.  I found that doing all the unit tests have also revealed some errors I wouldn't have thought to look for.</p>

<p>I'm also spending some time to day taking another stab at using Eclipse as my development environment.  Despite the lack of a working SFTP plugin, I can see how the benefits outweigh the annoyance of not being able to copy the files to the server.</p>

<p>Besides, I've started using my iBook as my development environment more and more.  Which is a good practice to get into, as I learn techniques for generating data sets for testing and making sure my code is portable across environments.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As you can see from the graphic in the upper-right-hand corner of my blog, the php|works conference isn't that far off.  I've been working on the outline for my talk "What Can PHP Learn From Rails?" and have settled upon the basics for it.</p>

<p>But it begs a bigger question:  is it possible to take what is really great about Rails (and by definition that means some great features of Ruby) and make it work in PHP?  When going to my friend <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek's</a> goodbye party (he's switching jobs to work for a company next door to his old one) I was talking to my old co-workers about my talk.  And they raised a good question: what are PHP's strengths.</p>

<p>I opened my mouth to say something and then closed it.  Maybe it was the beer that made me pause.  I'll be honest:  I really like Ruby and there are some really neat things being done.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with being able to duplicate a lot of what Rails is doing is, well, PHP isn't Ruby.  Ruby's method of treating everything like an object is something that PHP just can't do.  ActiveRecord in Ruby works so well because Ruby can examine it's own properties (I believe that is called reflection), and ActiveRecord takes full advantage of that.  One of the thrusts of my talk is that developers who are creating tools for other developers to use (I'm not talking about creating applications) have to use the strengths of PHP instead of railing (heh) against PHP's perceived limitations.</p>

<p>I've probably posted things like this before, but ActiveRecord is able to do things like this:</p>

<pre><code><br />person = new FamilyMember
data = person.find_by_last_name_and_sex('Hartjes', 'female')

</code></pre>

<p>Without me doing <em>anything</em>, ActiveRecord knows to translate this into "SELECT * FROM familymembers WHERE last_name = 'Hartjes' AND sex = 'female'</p>

<p>Can you do that in PHP? I do know that <a href=http://www.cakephp.org>CakePHP</a> (which has been getting lots of favourable reviews) has their own ActiveRecord implementation.  Can it do the above?  Not quite yet.  It does handle something like this: (taken from the CakePHP website):</p>

<pre><code><br />$this-&gt;Post-&gt;findByTitle('My First Blog Post');
$this-&gt;Author-&gt;findByLastName('Rogers');
$this-&gt;Property-&gt;findAllByState('AZ');
$this-&gt;Specimen-&gt;findAllByKingdom('Animalia');

</code></pre>

<p>I can see how this behaviour would be easier to implement in PHP 5, and I will have to take a look at CakePHP to see how they do it in PHP 4.  With a little bit of effort I'm sure you can add multiple terms to a PHP ActiveRecord implementation to mimic how ActiveRecord works in Ruby.</p>

<p>We, as PHP developers, should hesitate to take good ideas from other programming languages and see if there is a way to make an implementation that is just as easy to use as the original.  Object Relational Mapping works not just with ActiveRecord in Ruby, but with other items in Ruby as well.  I saw a slide show of David Heinemeier Hansson's presentation he gave at a Ruby conference in Japan.  He showed an item called ActiveResource that acts just like ActiveRecord but will work on all sorts of things.</p>

<p>Where are the people who are creating things like that in PHP 5?  Maybe people are doing that work, but they aren't as eager to share that info with the rest of the world as DHH (and the rest of the Rails crowd in general).  Maybe this is what happens when the core group of people working on a language gets to the point where one person can't drive the language my the sheer will of their ego.  This isn't a bad thing, by any means.  It shows that PHP has gotten a huge level of acceptance and that there are now many people capable of contributing to it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I should save some of this for my presentation instead of sharing it on the blog. :)</p>
