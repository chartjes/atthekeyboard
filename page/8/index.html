        <div>
            <p>On the <a href="https://devhell.info">/dev/hell podcast</a> episode I recorded with <a href="https://twitter.com/funkatron">Ed</a>
last night, I got the chance to talk at length about my early experiences with
my new laptop. According the 'About This Mac':</p>

<ul>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li>
<li>Processor 2.9 GHz Inetl Core i5</li>
<li>Memory 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3</li>
<li>Startup Disk Macintosh HD</li>
<li>Graphics Intel Iris Graphics 550 1536 MB</li>
<li>Pretentious Level High</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to a focus by Apple on People Not Like Me, I was able to get up and
running really quickly on my new laptop. The Migration Assistant worked
perfectly except for not copying over some saved game files for a Steam
game that I play quite a bit (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager_2016">Football Manager 2016</a>).
Especially when I have a setup that requires the use of SSH keys and applications
all configured to my liking, this was awesome.</p>

<p>My next thought turned to security. Clearly we are in a era where attempts to
access people's computers is on the rise. Not that I am thinking I am the
target of a shady cabal of l33t hax0rs being paid by shadowy security forces
of governments that don't like my politics, but I want to at least make them
work a bit. So I want to share what I decided to do.</p>

<p>I've been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault">FileVault</a> for a long
time (in fact, it was a requirement for me if I wished to use my own equipment
while working for Mozilla).</p>

<p>After that, you have all sorts of options. After seeing a Tweet from someone
mentioning a bunch of tools that can help increase the security of your laptop
I decided to take the plunge.</p>

<p>First, I installed <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little Snitch</a>.
It monitors all my network connections and provides me with a bunch of options
to allow or deny the connection, forever or just for a limited time. Starting
with this tool I had to (and still are, to a minor extent) acknowledge and
decide what to do about a ridiculous number of connection attempts by all sorts
of programs. For the older crowd, I feel like I am playing some new version of
Everquest. So. Much. Furious. Clicking.</p>

<p>Not content to develop repetitive stress injuries to my right hand, I installed
<a href="https://www.littleflocker.com/">Little Flocker</a>. It's a good complement
to Little Snitch -- it watches for any interactions with files, looks for
keystroke loggers, and checks for malware. More. Clicking.</p>

<p>Next up was to install <a href="https://obdev.at/products/microsnitch/index.html">Micro Snitch</a>
to tell me any time my webcamera and microphones were being used. More alerts
to acknowledge but at least my microphone only turns on when I need it to. So far.</p>

<p>Finally I installed <a href="https://objective-see.com/products/blockblock.html">BlockBlock</a>
to let me know if something keeps trying to install malware in known locations.
Just another layer of security for someone to overcome. They clearly indicate
that the application is in beta, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>With those apps installed and running and configured, I massaged my very sore
wrist and started reading <a href="https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide">this awesome document</a> at the
suggestion of a kind soul on Twitter. Lots of great stuff in there that you
can do and raises interesting points about deciding what type of threats you
are looking to protect yourself from. Here's a list of the advice from it that
I followed:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch everything when updates are available</li>
<li>frequent system backups (shoutout to <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a>)</li>
<li>full-volume encryption</li>
<li>third-party firewalls</li>
<li>Disable Spotlight Suggestions</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a></li>
<li>turn off captive portal</li>
<li>use <a href="https://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> as a local web proxy</li>
</ul>

<p>I plan on implementing some of the other recommendations, but that's what I
started with. For Mac users, please read through that document. So much good
stuff along with explanations of why you should do it.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p><em>UPDATE February 1, 2018</em></p>

<p>I received two emails recently pointing out a few things about the tools above.</p>

<p>The first was that the company that sponsors the work of Privoxy has a link on their web site to 
some very sketchy financial trading software. The person who informed me of
this was trying to get me to link to a free VPN solution they were promoting.
My personal view is that people running free VPN's are sniffing the hell out
of your traffic selling what you're are doing to someone. Make the decision to
use a free VPN service with your eyes wide open.</p>

<p>Secondly, I used to recommend the dnsmasq/DNSSEC/DNSCrypt combo but DNSCrypt is no longer available, so I
suggest you look for some other tools for encrypting your DNS traffic. The
person who emailed me about DNSCrypt pointed to a blog post they wrote about
about <a href="https://thebestvpn.com/dnscrypt-best-alternatives/">DNSCrypt alternatives</a>.
Either way, encrypting your DNS is a good idea so please consider it.</p>

<p>I used to recommend <a href="https://www.littleflocker.com/">Little Flocker</a> but it looks
like the project has become an F-Secure product and is no longer free. Check out
it's successor <a href="https://campaigns.f-secure.com/xfence/">F-Secure XFENCE</a></p>

            <h2 id="could-be-called-%27revenge-of-the-comfortable%27">Could Be Called 'Revenge Of The Comfortable'</h2>

<p>Welp, the Surface Book sat on my desk next to my MacBookAir in it's <a href="https://ca.hengedocks.com/">Henge Dock</a>
and didn't get used beyond Monday. I had some rough times with it that made
me retreat back into the comfortable arms of macOS.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2016/11/18/from-macos-to-win10-part-2">previous post</a>
I mentioned some things I had to take a look at. How did that go?</p>

<h3 id="needed-an-http-client-similar-to-paw">Needed an HTTP client similar to <a href="https://paw.cloud">Paw</a></h3>

<p>Ugh -- nothing I found was similar enough and I also encountered something
that became a recurring theme -- how much work did I want to do in order to
master a skill but using a different tool? The answer was "not much".</p>

<p>That's probably a personal failing but at age 45 I'm not sure how much time
I want to spend remapping those hard-fought memory mapped skills. I'm sure
you are starting to guess what the final conclusion might be.</p>

<h3 id="connect-to-external-monitor-and-keyboard">Connect To External Monitor And Keyboard</h3>

<p>I didn't bother pairing the bluetooth keyboard I'm currently typing on to
the Surface Book, but getting the monitor connected was. Multiple <em>hours</em>
spent trying to figure out what the problem was. Was it the drivers? Was it
my old monitor? What the hell was happening here -- mini display port to HDMI
works just fine on my Mac. In the end, it would only work when I used a
mini-display-port-to-VGA connector. It's 2016 and I was highly disappointed.</p>

<p>This then prompted another hour of me searching around looking at monitors
(hey, a 4K one sounds great) to discover it wouldn't work with my current
laptop and <em>might</em> not work correctly with a Surface Book (not all apps
scale properly).</p>

<h3 id="better-hosts-file-management">Better Hosts File Management</h3>

<p>"Just edit it with Notepad" -- said by people that never used <a href="http://gas-mask.apponic.com/mac/">Gas Mask</a></p>

<h3 id="battery-life-is-weird">Battery Life Is Weird</h3>

<p>One of the reasons I thought the Surface Book would be enticing is I could
detach the screen and use it as a tablet. That actually worked okay...but I
would run low on battery after about an hour of usage. That is way less than
what my ancient iPad 3 gives me.</p>

<p>I don't really use my laptop much unplugged, but a tablet that has really
poor battery life isn't that great.</p>

<h3 id="maybe-the-best-change-is-no-change">Maybe The Best Change Is No Change</h3>

<p>Look, I know people are going to think I'm weak-willed about this. Yes, the Win10
platform has made leaps and bounds. I did find it jarring to use, and I was
actually able to do everything I needed to do at my day job with it. Bash
on Win10 worked great (except for curl not working correctly). Atom was a
more than suitable editor. Firefox works just fine on Win10. I could do
most of what I want to do on Win10. But I would have to relearn a bunch of
tools. I'm not sure I want to do that.</p>

<p>I have to give back the Surface Book when I get back from a work meeting in
Hawaii (yes, sucks to be me) in a few weeks, so the decision is far from over.
One review I read said <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-week-with-the-new-macbook-pro-with-touch-pad-126eebb89ac#.tfcsz7pap">don't get it if you have a newish MBP</a> while another felt that Apple had
<a href="https://medium.com/@ageitgey/the-new-macbook-pro-is-kind-of-great-for-hackers-64c1c577a4d2#.1a7jc5ck3">built a great machine for hackers</a>.</p>

<p>Where does this leave someone with a 4-1/2 year old (that's 45 years in
internet time) MacBook Air? Even more confused than before.</p>

<p>I don't need the Touch Bar because my laptop will run in clamshell/lid-closed
mode approximately 99% of the time. What I really wanted was a MacBook
that has 32 GB of RAM. I can't get that right now. But will there be one
available in April? I would be super-pissed if that happened after I bought
a 16GB one.</p>

<p>I'm still more indecisive about it than ever.</p>

            <p>I spent this past week only using my loaner <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/devices/surface-book">Surface Book</a>
instead of my trusty MacBook Air for doing my work at the <a href="https://mozilla.com">day job</a>.
If there is a better of test for figuring out if I can do my regular work in it,
I can't think of one.</p>

<h2 id="it-has-linux-under-the-hood">It Has Linux Under The Hood</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2016/11/10/from-macos-to-win10-part-1/">previous post</a>
I talked about how you could get a Bash shell using Ubuntu 14 (I think) running
natively on Windows. Well, it absolutely 100% works except for one problem
that I had. I was trying to debug a problem with an API  using <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>
and it just wouldn't return anything at all. A quick pop back to macOS and
everything was just fine. Still no idea what the issue is, but I think I
need to try and reproduce it. I do know that the lead developer for curl
works at Mozilla so maybe I can get some help that way.</p>

<p>Otherwise, <em>everything</em> I normally do in the macOS terminal (well, <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>)
I was able to do just fine in the Bash shell in Windows 10. I was pleasantly
surprised.</p>

<p>All the other tools I used for work were just fine:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> editor behaved just fine</li>
<li>Firefox is cross-platform, everything was just fine</li>
<li>I didn't like how our video chat client looked (fonts way too small) but it worked</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, I could easily see myself using a Surface Book every day for
work. To be honest, if I didn't have access to the Bash shell I wouldn't even
have bothered trying to do this.</p>

<p>So what are the last few things I have to try out?</p>

<ul>
<li>need a HTTP client similar to <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a></li>
<li>connected to external monitor and keyboard</li>
<li>better hosts file management -- <a href="http://gas-mask.apponic.com/mac/">Gas Mask</a> is just so good</li>
<li>haven't fired up Skype in it yet</li>
<li>haven't looked at screencasting software</li>
</ul>

<p>Next week I should have another update on putting the last touches onto the
experience.</p>
