            <h2><a href="/2018/01/14/jan-2018-board-game-night/">January 2018 board game night</a></h2>
           <h3>January 14th, 2018</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>For many years I have been getting together with a group of people that
I met online when I used to play a lot of the paper-and-pencil
role-playing game <a href="http://www.herogames.com/">Hero System</a>. It started
getting harder and harder to get everyone together to play, which makes
any kind of long-running campaign impossible to maintain. If you don't
know from session to session who is going to be available, how can you
plan anything?!?!</p>

<p>So a few years back I decided the path going forward was for us to play
board games instead. That way if someone can't make it, it's not as
big a deal as having a character whom you built an entire campaign
around not showing up.</p>

<p>An email goes out saying it's time to play, we all indicate what
Saturdays work for an upcoming month (it's always a Saturday) and
once we get consensus we make plans to show up at someone's house (we
all take turns) and a good time is had by all attendees.</p>

<p>I apologize for the lack of pictures of the various board states but
the group is usually on my case to "put your damn phone away, Chris!!!"
so I am trying to be a better friend and tame my obvious phone addiction.
This time out 6 of the 8 members of our group showed up.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting challenges is making sure that we have games
that can handle that large number of people.</p>

<h2 id="hadz">Hadz</h2>

<p>We played this game while we waited for the last two members to show up.</p>

<p>My mother got me a beautiful hand-crafted board game called <a href="http://niconico.ca/?wpsc-product=hadz&amp;lang=en">Hadz</a>
that reminded me of the old game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)">Sorry</a> with some betting involved.</p>

<p>The game looks like it would take a while to go all the way through
and I am pretty sure we are missing out on some of the strategies that 
might lead to better outcomes. It was fun yelling at the top as it failed
to knock a marble into the locations you had bet on.</p>

<h2 id="joking-hazard">Joking Hazard</h2>

<p>If you've played <a href="https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Cards Against Humanity</a> you will be familiar with this
type of game. In <a href="https://explosm.net/joking-hazard">Joking Hazard</a> you are
trying to build the best three-panel comics with cards that contain the type
of material that is best played either by people who know each other very well
or by people who are easily amused by toilet humour or aggressively-sexual
content.</p>

<p>Not really my game but man some of the comics that got created were quite
dark. We played two rounds of that and then prepared for the main event.</p>

<h2 id="space-cadets">Space Cadets</h2>

<p>In this game you are a bunch of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123096/space-cadets">Space Cadets</a>
who are trying to complete a mission as the crew of a spaceship. Each turn
the crew members are trying to solve a puzzle specific to their assigned
station (helm, engineering, weapons, etc.) in order to advance the mission.
It's frantic, you always feel stressed and I'm not sure I really want to play
it again.</p>

<p>We've played it at least 4 times and have never one. In fact, I have no idea
how anyone ever completes the mission because the quality of puzzles that
need to be solved is quite uneven, and the critical station (tractor beams)
requires you to memorize the number, colour, shape, and location of puzzle
pieces by flipping them over two at a time.</p>

<p>The game can be exciting while you yell at crew members who don't complete
their tasks and put the crew in danger, but I think I'm done with it.</p>

<h2 id="quartermaster-general">Quartermaster General</h2>

<p>This game can be best described as "<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98/axis-allies">Axis and Allies</a> that you can actually
get done in one night." <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/159473/quartermaster-general">Quartermaster General</a>
is a game where all the players take the role of one of the Axis or Allied
powers in World War 2 and play out the war using a series of cards
and units representing tanks, ships, and aircraft. The game itself took
us about 2 hours but the first 30 minutes was just going over all the
rules and doing some sample turns.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this game. I got to be Germany, and I saw how the game
creators did a great job of representing the various power levels of
the combatants in the war. All of us made plenty of mistakes, and in the
end the Allies won victory by 8 points over the 20 turns. The owner of
the game said that he'd never seen a game go to turns. I will definitely
want to play this again.</p>

<p>There is an expansion set for that shakes things up via additional cards
that allows things to be more of a 50-50 proposition for the Axis. It
was pointed out to use that there were basically for scenarios all
based on on how well one side starts</p>

<p>Axis fast + Allies fast = Allies win
Axis fast + Allies slow = Axis wins
Axis slow + Allies fast = Allies ROFLstomp win
Axis slow + Allies slow = Allies win</p>

<p>Making it 50-50 allows for strategies to matter rather than simply
duplicating history.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>would play Hadz again with a smaller group to kill some time</li>
<li>not that enthused about Joking Hazard</li>
<li>don't want to play Space Cadet any time soon</li>
<li>would definitely play Quartermaster General again</li>
</ul>

            <p>I really like browsing through <a href="https://usesthis.com">Uses This</a> to see what
folks from all sorts of industries use to get the job done. Since they are
unlikely to invite me, here's my own details. I share in hopes of discovering
new tools for doing my job and showing folks who haven't been doing this for
20 years what "professional programmers" use. You might be surprised.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-you%2C-and-what-do-you-do%3F">Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>

<p>Monday to Thursday am I working for <a href="https://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> as part of
the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> Test Engineering group
where I test web services that Firefox talks to, along with deployment testing
of some internal developer tools and a <a href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto">generic JSON document store</a>
that we built ourselves.</p>

<p>On Fridays I continue to work on <a href="https://grumpy-learning.com">Grumpy Learning</a> stuff.
I'm currently writing a "how to test legacy PHP code" video training course for
a large online education provider and are organizing a personal-development course
called <a href="https://grumpy-learning.com/grumpy-conf.php">GrumpyConf</a> that will be held
March 22-24, 2018. No new books on the horizon and I currently only appearing at
<a href="https://tek18.phparch.com">phptek 2018</a> in late May of this year.</p>

<p>If you want me to come speak at your event in the fall, get in touch.</p>

<h3 id="what-hardware-do-you-use%3F">What hardware do you use?</h3>

<p>My main device is a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">13-inch 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar</a> with 
16 GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD drive. It runs in closed-mode 99.999% of the time
plugged into a <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-27-ultra-hd-4k-monitor-p2715q/apd/210-adof/monitors-monitor-accessories">Dell P2715Q display</a> and I use the Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english">Magic Keyboard</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2">Magic Mouse 2</a>. When I travel I bring a <a href="https://www.therooststand.com/">Roost laptop stand</a> with me. Being a Large Human
using the Roost has made it so I can actually work in environments other than
my configured-for-me home office.</p>

<p>I also make heavy use of an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone6s">iPhone 6S Plus</a>
mostly for messaging and <a href="https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer">Twitter</a> use.
I also have a Samsung Chromebook that I can do some PHP web development work on but
it is not powerful enough for the day job. I tried it out to see if it was
suitable as a road laptop for a world where border crossings can quickly
turn ugly. Right now it's not.</p>

<p>I listen to a lot of music (yay <a href="https://spotify.com">Spotify</a>) and since I
did notice the poor quality of audio from my laptop I splurged and bought
a <a href="http://www.audioquest.com/dragonfly-series/">DragonFll USB DAC</a> along with
the <a href="http://www.audioquest.com/jitterbug/jitterbug">Jitterbug USB data and power noise filter</a>.
I now have awesome, clean-sounding music coming from my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KVEIY4E/?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAALxg">desktop speakers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="and-what-software%3F">And what software?</h3>

<p>I use macOS (always using the latest stable version of it -- patch your systems people!)
as my development environment and some flavour of Linux (usually <a href="https://ubumtu.com">Ubuntu</a>)
as a deployment environment.</p>

<p>When I am doing <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> (which is what I use at Mozilla) I am using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>
and if I am doing <a href="https://php.org">PHP</a> I am using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>.
For everything else I am using <a href="https://neovim.io">Neovim</a>. I used to be a Vim-only person
but over the years I have found the value that IDE's provide me to be invaluable.
They have totally-acceptable-to-me Vim bindings anyway.</p>

<p>I make heavy use of the CLI and use <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>.</p>

<p>For work I rely on the following tools every single day:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://irccloud.com">IRCCloud</a> for talking to co-workers</li>
<li>Mozilla uses Google Mail and Google Calendar, which works nicely with my phone</li>
<li><a href="https://vidyo.com">Vidyo</a> for video conference -- great product, works well</li>
<li>Firefox web browser. I run the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/">Nightly</a> version</li>
</ul>

<p>When I do <a href="https://devhell.info">my podcast</a> with Ed, I use <a href="https://skype.com">Skype</a> with
the <a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/">Call Recorder</a> plug in. I send the recording
of my side to him and he fixes it all up.</p>

<p>On my iPhone I use the following apps quite a bit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mail.app</li>
<li>Mobile Safari</li>
<li><a href="https://twitterrific.com/ios/">Twitterrific</a> (and on macOS too)</li>
<li><a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> for listening to podcasts</li>
</ul>

<p>I also use all sorts of other apps (messaging ones mostly) like any long-time
user of an iOS device.</p>

<p>I am a competitive-casual <a href="https://magic.wizards.com">Magic: The Gathering</a>
player, mostly playing the Legacy format (but with a splash of Vintage
and the random cube or EDH game mixed in). For many years I was frustrated
with my lack of success at the tournament level. I was lucky enough to
fall in with a group of people who made me realize that I actually enjoyed
the social aspect of the game the most.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup%3F">What would be your dream setup?</h3>

<p>I've worked from home for 11 years now -- I never want to go back to a
full-time office experience ever again. I'm totally happy with my
computer and my display and all the other tools I use. I tend to upgrade
things incrementally instead of in big shots. I like consistency and
the ability to quickly get back to work when upgrading any of my
equipment.</p>

<p>I hope this helps! Got any more questions or suggestions of things I should
check out. Hit me up on Twitter or via the email link in the sidebar.</p>

           <h3>September 14th, 2017</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Back at the beginning of August my long-suffering wife and I packed
up our possessions and moved almost 2 hours away to a small village
of ~2500 people into a house on a street that doesn't seem to show
up on a lot of major GPS systems. Luckily it shows up both on Apple
and Google maps, and there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hortons">Tim Hortons</a>
close by to act as a known landmark and guide people in.</p>

<p>With the move came an opportunity to Do Something Different with the
home wireless setup. In the past, I used a good, consumer-grade home
wireless router and it was usually good enough. Sometimes my oldest
daughter (her room was the furthest away from the wifi router) would
complain about poor signal, so I bought some <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/network-extenders/range-extenders">wifi extenders</a>
and those did the trick.</p>

<p>So this sort of thing was great...but I felt like I was not prepared
for the near-future, which is a home filled with all sorts of devices
that will connect via wifi to do things. I got a <a href="https://nest.com/thermostats/nest-learning-thermostat/overview/">Nest thermostat</a> and was going to have an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y6FSV5Q/?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAAMEe">awesome TV</a> that needed a network connection. I also would have an older <a href="https://www.roku.com">Roku</a>
device that would want to be on the network. Not to mention my own
devices for work...and my wife's iPad and iPhone...and devices my
kids were going to be using.</p>

<p>In short, I wanted to future-proof my network somewhat and try and
anticipate an explosion of devices that would need to be connected
to it. Yes, I am aware of some security implications and I am going
to be working on minimizing the exposure these things will have to
my network.</p>

<p>At some point I came across Troy Hunt's great blog post explaining
how he <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/wiring-a-home-network-from-the-ground-up-with-ubiquiti/">helped wire his brother's home</a>
with some great networking hardware. I clearly am not re-inventing
the wheel here -- Troy's template is one that I would absolutely
follow...if you have the ability to run wires in your home.</p>

<p>In my case, it was not going to be a problem. The previous owner had
been using VoIP for their phones so there were already several wired
connections backed by cat5. I was going to need some other lines run
throughout the house but it was not going to be an issue.</p>

<p>So I ended up with most of the hardware Troy recommended in his blog
post:</p>

<ul>
<li>7 in-wall 802.11ac access points throughout the house</li>
<li>1 24-port Power-over-ethernet switch</li>
<li>1 security gateway device that I am slowly learning how to configure correctly</li>
<li>4 cat5 connections for the access points</li>
<li>3 cat6 connections for the other access points</li>
<li>6u server cabinet (helpfully mounted on the wall) for all the equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>I kept my existing <a href="https://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/R6400.aspx">wifi router</a>,
converted it to an access point, and plugged
it into the switch because my youngest's Netbook refused to connect to the new hardware.</p>

<p>But why go to all this trouble and expense (it cost me CDN$2k for hardware and another CDN$1.5k for the cabling work) for
my home network? Flexibility. This setup will be great for as long as gigabit
ethernet remains faster than anything I can get at my home. Right now our
<a href="http://quadro.net">local internet provider</a> provides me with 50Mbps down / 5 Mbps
up over coax -- the modem is mounted on the wall next to the cabinet.
At some point they will be upgrading connections around here -- less than 1km 
away they are building a brand new subdivision with gigabit fiber being run to
homes. When the time comes, I'll just have to update the modem...and nothing
else. Maybe at some point <a href="https://www.ubnt.com">Ubiquiti</a> releases some nicer in-room access points.
I can just swap my old ones for the new ones and everything else will just still
work great.</p>

<p>Each room has an access point now that covers a small area. The equipment smoothly
handles transitions from one location to another, and I can get to see some
cool reports about who is doing what (how much is my youngest watching YouTube?!?)
and adding and removing hardware for this setup is easy.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this type of setup for your home:</p>

<ul>
<li>centralized location of a switch near where your modem / internet connection enters</li>
<li>wired connections to multiple locations, terminating near the switch</li>
<li>in-wall or very small, unobtrusive access points</li>
</ul>

<p>I realize not everyone can do this -- apartments and older homes make this very
impractical. I would recommend looking into mesh networks (Ubiquiti's consumer
line of Amplifi look really good) to give yourself sufficient capacity. The
number of network-aware or even network-required devices is only to go up, not down. If you can get out in
front of it a little bit you'll be in a great spot to take advantage of it.</p>
