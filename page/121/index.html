        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Over at the PragDave blog (written by Dave Thomas of the Pragmatic Programmers) he has a very interesting article about a <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/2007/03/the_radar_archi.html">new architecture for web applications</a> that he calls RADAR for RESTful Application, Dumb-Ass Recipient.  Why do I think this is important?  Because it makes so much sense. :)</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, he is advocating that you build the core of your web application to supply information via a REST application server, then create a proxy server that can serve up the information in HTML format for clients that can't easily speak REST's language of XML responses, like a web browser.  He has a great section in there:

<blockquote>
Does that mean I'm down on the RESTful, CRUD based approach to application development? Not at all. For some categories of application, I think it's a great way of structuring your code. But REST isn't designed for talking to people. So let's accept that fact when creating applications. And, while we're at it, let's take advantage of the fact that HTTP is such a flexible transport. Rather than trying to design one monolithic application than has both the CRUD functionality and the smarts to be able to talk HTML to end users, why not split it into two smaller and simpler applications?
</blockquote>

So, you can still serve up your data with REST for "smart clients" that can directly manipulate the XML resulting from a REST call, but why not filter the REST response through some code that can then output a much-easier-for-humans-to-read version in HTML?
</p>

<p>
This isn't really a radical concept, as most people are doing something similar to this already in their code.  He is just advocating doing this on a more defined level instead of just in your code.  See, in Ruby on Rails you have the ability to specify what controller / action pair you want for different output types using something called 'respond_to'.  Now, I've used it a tiny bit and while it is a very neat bit of code, it does look kind of hackish to me as well.
</p>

<p>
Instead, continue to use a REST service as the core application server and then have, for example, an HTML application server that will read data from the REST service and manipulating so it looks real-pretty-like for display purposes.  Ironically, before I read this article I had been structuring the new IBL web site along these lines.  That site is kicking me in the ass because it's PHP 4 only, and PHP 4's XML parsing is just terrible.  Give me SimpleXML or give me death!  Nate has been helping me figure out how to use the XML object in CakePHP, but I have to do a lot of work on the data before it's in a presentable format.  Maybe I will do as Nate suggested and try pushing the XML stuff into the new Set object and see what happens.  You never know.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, check out the article on RADAR and see what sort of ideas it gives you in terms of restructuring the architecture of your application.  Simple is good, and this looks like a very simple architecture to understand.

           <h3>March 31st, 2007</h3>

        <div>
            <p>As I finish up week 3 at my new job, I have had more code reviews in 3 weeks than I have had in my last 5 years of work.  This is no lie.</p>

<p>
Right now, a code review consists of me either sitting right next to my boss looking at my code on a big monitor or talking via Skype while I am connected to a gotomeeting.com session he is hosting.  Either way, he is in the driver's seat and we go through my code, refactoring things and discussing the original goals of whatever it was I was supposed to be doing.  When we're done, he commits the changes back into our <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">svn</a> repository, and I'm left to go back and test everything we've changed.
</p>

<p>
So far, to be honest, the reviews have been just fine.  What I'm lacking right now is elegance in the code.  My boss likes to joke about making metrosexual code, but what he's really after is code that is elegant, readable, and as simple as possible.  I find that while my code is getting the job done properly, it could be more elegant as I learn (and in some cases relearn) some of the finer points of design and move towards a more OOP-style of thinking instead of the mishmash of OOP and functional I seem to gravitate towards.
</p>

<p>
Things like returning objects (so that we can chain things as needed), and dumping nested ifs for the sake of readability.  Above all though, he's encouraging me to think about what I'm doing instead of just banging out the code.  Nobody I know gets paid per line of code, and my boss is not some dimwitted pointy-haired-boss who is impressed by the volume of my output as opposed to the quality of what I'm doing.  For the IPTV project I'm working on, the code HAS to be bulletproof and HAS to be able to run unattended as I won't be able to log into the server to hack things on the fly.  I've got a healthy enough level of self-esteem that I am able to take these code reviews not as criticism (which they are not, but would be if I was thin-skinned or had too much ego invested in my code) but as an invaluable opportunity to go back and fix assumptions, drill the manta of elegant code into my programmer's brain, and unlearn bad habits from years of essentially unsupervised programming.  Ouch, kind of hurts to read that now that I've typed it.  
</p>

<p>
Code reviews and unit testing are probably the two things developers try to avoid as much as they can.  Don't be scared of either one.  You will not believe how much you can benefit from a code review, xtreme programming-style, with a developer who knows what he's doing.

           <h3>March 28th, 2007</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Sometimes you make a blog post that generates a lot of feedback.  In this case, Nate from CakePHP had a vigorous conversation with me via IM about my blog posting <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2007/03/23/in-spring-time-a-not-so-young-php-programmers-mind-turns-to-frameworks/">about frameworks</a>.  In a nutshell, Nate took issue with my comment that CakePHP isn't quite there yet because you can't use components from it outside the framework itself.</p>

<p>
Nate does have a point here.  Zend Framework is perhaps being *overly* ambitious by not only providing an MVC component, but you can use parts of it outside that MVC component as long as you place the Zend Framework itself in your path.  So is Zend Framework truly a framework?  Yes, as long as you understand that a web application framework means more than just a MVC-based framework.
</p>

<p>
At this point, CakePHP is an MVC-based framework only.  That is changing (remember my interactive console project?), but Nate's argument was that perhaps Zend Framework is unfocused and should be concentrating on the MVC part of the web application problem.  Not to mention the fact that it still doesn't have an Active Record implementation for database access.  This particular thing baffles me, but what can you do?  Zend_Db_ActiveRecord (or whatever you could call it) wasn't a priority among the core developers for Zend Framework.  I still can't believe that I have to write SQL by hand with Zend Framework, when I have all those magic methods available to me in CakePHP.
</p>

<p>
Which brings me around to another point.  A disproportionately large number of successful open-source projects are the creation of one, very talented, egomaniacal developer.  David Heinemeier Hansson is a great developer (and has a big ego from what I've seen, heard and read about him) and still is one of the main driving forces behind Ruby on Rails.  Without him being there at the beginning, deciding on the core features and rejecting anything he didn't like, who knows how Rails would've ended up?  One of the toughest things to do is to say "no" to someone when they ask you for something.  Not many people can do it.  It's an especially important skill to have as a developer, because adding in features when they don't really add anything of value is the kiss of death for an application</p>

<p>
So, as a result of this sort of "cult of personality" that surrounds open source projects (or any popular project) you get people initially choosing projects based on the recommendations of others, not on the merits of the project itself.  Why pick Zend Framework?  It's rich in libraries, backed by a large well-known company in the industry, and has many talented contributors (including yours truly).  But *why* use it for your particular project?  Biggest flaw right now as I can see it is (beating a dead horse here today) lack of an ORM database wrapper.  Again, CakePHP has one so it can't be *that* hard to implement such a thing.  I know that <a href="http://pixelated-dreams.com/">Davey Shafik</a> has created such a beast for Zend Framework...but it's nowhere to be seen in ZF 0.91 beta and likely ZF 1.0.  C'mon, cut Davey a break and ram it in there.
</p>

<p>
So, at this point, CakePHP is probably better suited for building an MVC application, despite the lack of libraries that Zend Framework provides that CakePHP does not.  On the other hand, a decent programmer should be able to quickly implement such things themselves, right?  So, for MVC-based apps that I need to build in a hurry I'm going to pick CakePHP.
</p>

<p>There, Nate.  You happy now?</p>
