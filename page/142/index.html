Day 2 is over and I had a good time.  Lots of great feedback from people who saw my talk, which again is good for the ego and will definitely encourage me to push this talk to other conferences and even come up with some more talks.
</p>

<p>
After the Flash talking to PHP session I went to a talk by Lukas Smith on creating portable database code.  I had been thinking about a lot of these things for my supersecret rallyhat.com project, so it's nice to get a complimentary viewpoint on it.  Again, I wish I had thought of this stuff when working on the <a href="http://www.sexsearch.com">dating site</a> stuff instead of the horrible mishmash we ended up creating.  Learn from your mistakes is the key.
</p>

<p>
Oh yeah, I also got a mention over at the Zend Developer Zone in Cal Evan's round-up about <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/916">day 2 at php|works.</a> After my interview yesterday he told me that the interview should be available in about a month as he's still processing the interviews he did at OSCON.

Phew!  My talk is over and I think it went really well.  I was *so* nervous for the first 5 minutes or so but cruised along nicely.  I even finished with 5 minutes to spare.  I want to thank all the people who came up to me after the talk and told me how they liked it and that I did a good job.  Nothing like a little ego boost to make you come through nicely after a stressful time.

I'm currently in Chrsitan Wenz's talk on using Flash with PHP.  At work, we're creating a flash movie for use on our web sites that interacts with a module I've created to parse the XML stream that Sportsticker sends out.  I think I will send a link to this presentation to our flash guy (who I think could use some tips on interacting with a PHP script via Flash) so he can get a better understanding of what we need to do.

I'm sitting in the keynote on day 2 where Joe Stagner from Microsoft is talking about how to make PHP play nicely with Microsoft's various tools, ranging from IIS to how to talk to Excell.  I don't have any sites that run on IIS but I can imagine that a lot of people are doing  so.
</p>

<p>
So, while he's talking I'm going over my slides for my presentation.  I'd be lieing if I said I wasn't nervous, but I should be okay once I get going.
