<i>(Note: after being schooled by Nate Abele via IM about the various ways you can deal with schemas without built-in relationships, I have altered the post)</i>
</p>

<p>
Now you've decided to convert your legacy app over to CakePHP, you will run into the first serious obstacle:  your database schema. If your schema does not already account for relationships between multiple tables you are in for a lot of extra work.  If the tables already have foreign keys pointing to other tables, you're in pretty good shape.
</p>

<p>
If you're still looking at not having foreign keys in the existing schema, all is not lost.  You can set the foreignKey property in a model association to false and then create a custom query that pulls in the joined records, which I imagine is useful if you need to use multiple foreign keys or something.  So despite my previously hard line stance on this, you *can* deal with tables that don't have bulit-in foreign keys.  It's just extra work. 
</p>

<p>
Without a database schema that contains relationships, you will not be able to use CakePHP's awesome associated data mapping abilities that are offered as part of the model.  Basically, given a set of conditions and knowing the relationships between the tables it will generate fairly well-tuned SQL queries and then return the results to you as nested arrays.  Is this perfect ORM?  No, but it's very easy to pass these result sets to your views for iterating over.
</p>

<p>
In my case, this was going to be the easiest part: the schema already contained relationships between the tables so I was able to use the Cake console and in under an hour I had used 'cake bake' to create all my models.  I did go back after the fact and tweak some of the relationships because they weren't *perfect* matches with the Cake conventions, but that was the exception rather than the rule.  Had there been no relationships between the tables, or extreme denormalizing of the data, I am unsure what I would've done.
</p>

<p>
On the topic of working with denormalized data, I'll late Nate speak for himself here:
<blockquote>
"Again, you can get this to work fine, it just takes a bit of extra effort.  It's nice when you can move this effort down to the database (i.e. cascading foreign key updates) but if not, you just have to write a little extra callback code."
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
What Nate is referring to here is that you will have to some work in your models to create functions as "callbacks" that are executed when performing updates or saves.  For example, a site I worked on had broken out user profile information into 4 different tables depending on what type of search you were doing.  In this case, I'd be writing a callback function that would go and update all the other search tables whenever I updated the master record.  That's the "cascading foreign key updates" thing Nate is referring to.
</p>

<p>
Now that I had my models, it was time to start thinking about how to switch over old queries.  In order to understand how to turn old SQL queries into results you get from Cake, I think you have to understand the following things (all of this applies to Cake PHP 1.2):
<ul>
<li>Understanding how relationships (i.e. hasMany, hasAndBelongsToMany) work in CakePHP.</li>
<li>How to use the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/474/Containable">Containable behavior</a> so you limit what comes back in the result set</li>
<li>Pretty solid SQL skills so you can decipher legacy code that might be using JOINS and subselects</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I think that if you are really good at those three things, you will be able to quickly determine how to turn that legacy SQL code into the proper parameters that need to be passed to your models to get back the results you need.
</p>

<p>
So now armed with the tools needed to convert those old queries over, I was onto the next and probably most difficult part of this particular project:  converting the old page controllers that used a token-replacement system for the templates over to Cake controllers and views.

           <h3>November 28th, 2008</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>In anticipation of my <a href="http://conf.phpquebec.com/en/session#deployment_is_not_a_4_letter_word">talk at PHP Quebec 2009</a> I've been going over my slides and thinking about what I'm going to update for it.  One little nugget I'd thought I'd share is one way of handling having multiple environments your code must run in.
</p>

<p>
For a work application, I have *three* environments that the code must run in:  'dev' (which is my laptop), 'staging' (which is where I look for the infamous "bug does not exist in production" type of errors), and 'production'.  For all these environments, there are different web services that they need to speak to so I tried to think of an easy way to handle this.  I have a configuration file that is used, so it seemed to me that this would be a logical place to do the *check* for what environment we are in.  But *how* to define where we are?  That turned out to be easy.
</p>

<p>
If you are using Apache, you have the ability to define server variables that can be read in using $_SERVER.  I'm sure you can do the same thing with other web servers, but this example is Apache-specific.  So, I figured the best way to handle this problem was to define a server variable and have a unique value for each environment.  Then, I added in code that checks the contents of that server variable and reacted accordingly.  Here's an example:
</p>

<p>
~~~
<?php
// In Apache, add SetEnv APP_ENV "<unique environment value>" somewhere in your http.conf file
// e.g. SetEnv APP_ENV 'dev'

switch ($_SERVER['APP_ENV']) {
    case 'dev':
        $config['webservice'] = 'http://admin@localhost:8008';
        $config['putfeed'] = 'http://dev.domain.com:8080/put/sml';
        break;
    case 'production':
        $config['webservice'] = 'http://admin|password@ws.domain.com:8080';
        $config['putfeed'] = 'http://in.domain.com/put/sml';
        break;
}
?>
~~~
</p>

<p>(NOTE:  <a href="http://snook.ca/jonathan/">Jonathan Snook</a> asked me to add an example on how to configure SetEnv)</p>

<p>
Then, in your Apache httpd.conf file you add the SetEnv directive.  Here's a snippet of how I did it for a work project:
~~~
<virtualhost *:80> 
     ServerName local.sportso.com 
     DocumentRoot /Users/chartjes/Sites/sportso.com 
     SetEnv SPORTSO_ENV "dev" 
  
     <directory /Users/chartjes/Sites/sportso.com> 
         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews 
         AllowOverride None 
         Order allow,deny 
         Allow from all 
          
         RewriteEngine on 
         RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^last-accessed=(.*)$ 
         RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1/last-accessed/%1? 
         RewriteRule ^$ /index.php [L] 
         RewriteRule ^/$ /index.php [L] 
         RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|images|styles|js|robots\.txt) 
         RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1 [L] 
     </directory> 
      
     LogLevel warn 
     ErrorLog /opt/local/apache2/logs/sportso.com-error.log 
     CustomLog /opt/local/apache2/logs/sportso.com-access.log combined 
</virtualhost> 
~~~
</p>

<p>
Hope that helps out any other developers struggling to think of an elegant way to determine what environment you are in.  As opposed to the lazy method of checking a production version of the config file into your version control system and then simply not checking back in the hacked-up dev version of it. ;)

        <div>
            <p>In order to make some extra money, I do side projects from time to time.  In my rapidly dwidling spare time I have been working on a project to convert an existing site for a legal services company over to PHP.  I'm *this* close to being done, so I thought I'd share what I went through to get to where I am right now.</p>

<p>
The existing code is typical of what I call the pre-framework era.  It had grown organically, much like many applications do.  When I initially did the code review (contact me if you're interested in having me do a code review of your application) I noticed lots of stuff that needed fixing.  No escaping of database input or filter of output.  Plaintext passwords in the database.  Total mixing of business logic with presentation logic.  To make things a little more difficult, SOME of the application was done properly in terms of separating business logic from presentation logic through a system of HTML templates that would have parts of it filled in via token replacement.  Not great, but not the end of the world.
</p>

<p>
I could also tell that multiple people had worked on it.  How?  Inconsistency in coding standards.  That and the comments strewn throughout it indicating who had done what.  Did I also mention that no version control was used on the project at all, so lots of copies of files like user_search.php.old, user_search.php.old.2.  You get the idea.  The best news of all was that the application DID work and met the objectives of the business.  Never lose sight of that when contemplating a legacy rewrite.
</p>

<p>
So after giving the code review I was asked to do the rewrite.  The client realized that they had some serious maintenance issues on their hands and were in the process of creating a new look-and-feel for the site.  Being the framework guy that I am, I indicated that porting the code over to a framework would be the best way to reduce maintenance issues going forward.  Why?  More and more developers are starting to work with frameworks, and gaining the discipline that comes from using the Model-View-Controller design pattern.  Also it would be a lot easier to start creating new templates for the site since only the presentation will be changing, not the data itself.
</p>

<p>
After considering using this project as a learning tool for Django, I settled on CakePHP.  Time was sort of important here and I thought that a paying job was not one where I should be fooling around learning Django.  Plus I had no confidence that the host they were using would be able to accomodate my desire for a Python + Django + mod_wsgi setup. 
</p>

<p>
In part two I will talk about the first thing I did once I started:  tackle the database structure.
