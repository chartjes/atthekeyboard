            <h2><a href="/2009/08/22/book-review-coders-at-work/">Book Review -- Coders At Work</a></h2>
           <h3>August 22nd, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I was fortunate enough to get a sneak peek at Peter Seibel's <a href="http://www.codersatwork.com/">Coders At Work</a>, where he interviewed 15 programmers, many of whom are considered legends in programming, to get their thoughts on a wide variety of topics related to programming.  These range from Brad Fitzpatrick (Live Journal and memcached to name some of his well-known projects) to Simon Peyton Jones (one of the creators of Haskell). Although I have not finished the book yet (it's 454 pages and I'm about 200 pages in) it has already left quite an impression on me.</p>

<p>
Mr. Seibel has also previously written an award-winning book about Lisp called "Practical Common Lisp".  With a pedigree like that, how could I ignore a book like this, despite my suspicion that those who understand Lisp are aliens from another planet?
</p>

<p>
While I read a lot of technical books and web sites, I have grown more-and-more to like books that get into the minds of the people behind the technology.  It's not that I'm expecting to find the perfect process for creating awesome projects, because that seems to be the residue of great skill and timing.  I'm interested in reading about the personalities that created these things.  Maybe I'm indulging in a little hero worship, but I can't imagine a better teacher than those who've climbed to the top and also are willing to share their failures along the way.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Peter Seibel seems to have found the right mix of questions and follow-ups to coax information from his interview subjects.  When you read about this larger-than-life people who've built projects that you understand were an huge undertaking have been a success, it's, what word am I looking for, reassuring to find that they are human beings with their own unique personalities, but all driven to succeed.  
</p>

<p>The range of topics covered is just astounding.  I could write a book just summarizing them, another tribute to Mr. Seibel's ability to get his subjects to open up and go into detail.  Not that most techies have a hard time speaking volumes on the topics they are interested in.  I've read thoughts on college CS education, virtual machines, pair programming, learning the value of interfaces to meld wildly different technologies...all things that I am interested in or want to learn more about it.  Perhaps I'm the perfect target audience for a book like this.  Reading these people's thoughts on them makes me realize where I actually have an in-depth understanding and where I have just scratched the surface of the available knowledge.
</p>

<p>
I highly recommend this book if you're interested in finding out what makes some of the people who have helped to build and expand the amazing world-wide computer network we call the Internet tick.  If anything, it will show just how much thought goes into the planning and execution of projects that we sometimes don't give enough credit.

           <h3>August 15th, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>(This is the 4th part in series about my experiences as a telecommuting developer.  For more info, check out <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2009/08/08/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-3-collaboration/">part 3, </a><a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2009/08/01/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-2-accountability/">part 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2009/07/29/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-1-building-trust/">part 1</a>)</p>

<p>
If you really want to set of a flame war on the internet, start talking about what you use as (a) your programming language and (b) what editor / IDE you use.  Thankfully, this posting is not about either one of those things.  After all, who can argue with using <a href="http://www.vim.org>the One True Editor</a>.  Here, I want to share my thoughts on the type of tools you are likely to need as a telecommuting developer.
</p>
<p>
So now that you've gotten the trust of your employer, and you have tools in place to provide accountability, and have a system in place to collaborate with your fellow employees (hah, tied those all together nicely!) we now have to talk about what you are going to use to get the job done.  
</p>
<p>
Chances are that if you are telecommuting, you are working for a small company.  Which also means that it is very likely that you will doing a lot more than just writing your code and handing it off to someone else for deployment into production.  When you also take into account that response times for your fellow telecommuters is likely slower than if you were in the same office, you almost needs to put into place practices that are defensive in nature.
</p>
<p>
The importance of a reliable set of development tools is something I've touched upon both in previous posts on this blog and in talks I've given.   This toolset becomes even more important when you're responsible for getting your code into a state where you can deploy it with confidence.  There is a reason that the amount of information available about unit testing, continuous deployment, and tools for automating other parts of the development process has exploded lately:  they are all things that can help you get error-free code deployed faster.
</p>
<p>
Many do not believe in the Cult of Unit Testing, and that's okay.  There are lots of other testing that can be done.  Even something as simple as testing things out in a browser can become a critical part of your programming toolkit.  I'm sure it comes as no shock to people how many bugs slip through the development process and into production that could've been detected with a simple check of the application via a web browser.  We are all guilty of this kind of thing.  These days thanks to things like <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> and <a href="http://www.getwindmill.com/">Windmill</a> it is easier than ever to create scripted web browser sessions for testing purposed.  
</p>
<p>
Sure, it will take time to learn to use these tools but it's hard to argue that it is anything other than (a) laziness or (b) fear of the unknown in the form of other languages or environments that stops people from implementing tools that will give you such a huge return on the investment made into setting them up.  I have been guilty of this in the past too, so I'm familiar with the anxiety that accompanies the attempt to automate parts of your testing.
</p>
<p>
So with some sort of testing in place, the next step is to get into place automated deployment tools.  Readers of my blog know my fondness for <a href="http://www.capify.org/index.php/Capistrano">Capistrano</a>, and it's use has become an integral part of my toolkit.  Why?   It allows me to do automated *repeatable* deployments to both my staging and production environments.  I work very hard to eliminate the idea that "we need to do things differently in production", because you can pretty much guarantee that you will end up with bugs that only exist in production and are difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate in your development environment.
</p>
<p>
I am not aware of any tools like Capistrano that exist for those who use Windows as their production stack.  If you know of some, let me know in the comments.  For my friends who use PHP and cannot use Ruby, I highly recommend investigating the use of <a href="http://phing.info/trac/">Phing</a> as a substitute.  I've also been playing around with <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/fab/">Fabric</a> as an alternative to Capistrano.  Much as with testing, there is no shortage of tools available to you.  Heck, even something as simple as shell scripts that check out your code from version control and copy it into a desired location are a step up from manual deployment of code.  Sure, it's easy to do 'svn update' in a directory, but that will only be easy until you have to start doing things like database changes at the same time.
</p>
<p>
I guess what I'm really trying to say is that you should be using tools that make deploying error-free code into production *easier*, because chances are you will be the one doing the deployment.  Where I work, each developer is responsible for deploying their own code so it was in my best interest to create something that was "fire and forget" when it came to pushing up changes.  Need to copy new scripts in place for pulling data from our XML db?  No problem.  Need to update the schema for the database?  No problem, got it totally covered.
</p>
<p>
A lot of these issues are something I've covered <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2008/04/17/deployment-is-not-a-4-letter-word-the-screencast/">before</a>.  Instead I will focus on a final thought on tools -- they need to be as easy to use as possible.
</p>

<p>
When you telecommute, one of the biggest problems is response time.  Since you're not in the same office (or even same city) as your co-workers, when something goes wrong it is likely that you will have to be the one that fixes it without help from others.  Building a tool kit like the one I've suggested will go a long way towards helping you when things go wrong.  Which they will.  By automating as much of this as possible, it becomes quite simple to fix any problems.
</p>

<p>
If you have to fight against your tools, then I think you're doing it all wrong.  Surround yourself with tools that you are comfortable using, and understand just how essential they really are.  When I think of how I used to program when I started 12 years ago, I have no idea how I got anything substantial done.  With my tool set in place, I'm ready to tackle just about anything I need to do at work.  My ability to customize the tools I use means I can do my job from anywhere I can get a reliable internet connection.  And that is really the key to successful telecommuting:  getting things done so they won't ever ask you to come into the office again.
</p>

<p>
Thanks so much for reading this series on telecommuting.  If you have any questions about anything I've discussed here, feel free to add them to the comments.

           <h3>August 8th, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>(This is part 3 of an ongoing series about my experiences with telecommuting and the tools and practices I feel help make it work)</p>

<p>This post has a little bit of crossover with <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2009/08/01/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-2-accountability/">second post</a> in this series, so you'll have to forgive me if you see something I talked about before.  Now that's we've identified the issues of trust and accountability, the next big issue a telecommuter faces is one of collaboration.
</p>

<p>
So now that you've gotten an environment created where you are being trusted to do your work as assigned (despite what people think, just doing a good job isn't always enough in the minds of those who manage programmers and designers), and you have a way to be held accountable for the stuff you are working on, we are on to the sticky issue of collaboration.
</p>

<p>
As an aside, it is important to understand that if your company creates things that other people use, there is a big difference between how you communicate with your customers and how you communicate with your co-workers.  You might consider me cynical, but your communications with your customers need to be in such a way that you have control over the channels.  Otherwise you open yourself to chaos and miscommunication.  Although we do have email addresses used for support, we are consistent in our messages to our customers that we need them to use the ticketing system.  Otherwise they run the risk of having their problems not dealt with in a timely manner.
</p>

<p>
Internally, our main method of collaboration is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc">IRC</a>.  We have our own server, and we use IRC as the second line of support for our clients, encouraging them to log in and join us in IRC for problem solving sessions that just can't be done via email.  We all stay logged into our main company channel and usually logged in to the main support channel.  By having one central location where we hang out online, it allows us to (a) log all conversations for later review and (b) allow digging find solutions we talked about earlier but never turned into internal tickets.
</p>

<p>
However, I do find that the nature of IRC at work is much like instant messaging: it creates an air of perpetual interruption.   Luckily, there are easy ways to deal with the problem.  My <a href="http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus">IRC client</a> lets me set alerts for messages.  I have it chirp out very loudly whenever someone in IRC types my name in a message.  That way, I can concentrate on coding and then shift over to IRC when my attention is required.  Otherwise, you would be forever checking the chat window to see if I need to deal with anything.
</p>

<p>
If we didn't already use IRC (it was being used before I got here) I would recommend using something like <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a>.  It's a good mix between IRC and instant messaging, and you can find some <a href="http://www.karppinen.fi/pyro/">interesting</a> <a href="http://propaneapp.com/">clients</a> for it if you don't want to use a web-based interface.  I imagine the only bad thing is that someone else is storing logs of your conversations.  Personally, I don't worry about that sort of thing since it's very unlikely anyone who really cares about what you're doing will see those conversations.  Plus, it is not free but I think the service is worth it.
</p>

<p>
What you use isn't really important, so long as you're using something that allows everyone to be in one location and that you can log what's been talked about.  The ability to easily share ideas and links is critical.  To me, email lacks the immediacy that a telecommuter who has to collaborate with his workers on a regular basis needs.  Plus, emails are way too easy to ignore.  How many times has a colleague who you suspected didn't want to do something for you claimed "I never got that email."
</p>

<p>
So typically we will discuss things in IRC, then follow-up with either internal tickets or emails that draw in people outside the company if required.  There is the odd conference call for myself, but my co-workers seem to have more of them than I do.  Our weekly meetings are done in IRC as well, eliminating the need for what would likely be a time-wasting 7-person conference call full of stops and starts and dropped calls.  IRC for the win!
</p>

<p>
I'm sure I've only scratched the surface of collaboration for remote workers, but I think if you make it an early priority to have a communications method where all workers can hang out without giving it their constant 100% attention, then you will find a more natural workflow will emerge.  For telecommuters, it's all about the work flow.
