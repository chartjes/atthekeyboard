            <p>My side project is <a href='http://rallyhat.com'>Rallyhat</a>, an idea I've had for some time now.  Basically, it's a digital photo scavenger hunt with a nice social networking twist.  I have a teaser page up right now where you can submit your email address to be notified of when a beta is ready to be used.</p>

<p>
It's built using Ruby on Rails.  Why Rails?  Well, aside from all my soul-searching about what to use, there is a simple reason:  I could build it in PHP quite easily, but where's the challenge in that?  All my side projects teach me something and I'm confident I'll come out of this as a kick-ass Rails developer, along with learning some techniques I can apply to my PHP programming.
</p>

<p>
Please visit the site, sign up to be notified of the availability of a beta release and let me know any comments you might have.

            <p>There was a posting on the <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> mailing list today from someone asking for sources of advice on "starting big applications".  Having gone through this at my previous job, I posted the following response:
<br />
<blockquote>
Just to inject some sanity into what should be a very interesting
thread, I urge anyone building an application to simply BUILD IT and
worry about the profiling / benchmarking for AFTER you've built it.
Trust me when I say this:  no application of any significant size
survives long enough to be scaled past it's original intent without
wholesale architectural changes.  You *WILL* be rewriting things, you
*WILL* be rethinking how your application is organized.  Like Death
and taxes, it is inevitable.  But you can worry about it later.

I say this as someone who has been through the "let's build something
massive" process, only to see it fail horribly due to all sorts of
preconceptions at design time that resulted in major rewrites that no
benchmarking would've helped.  We didn't know what the bottlenecks
were until we actually saw them get hit, and then we set about
rewriting the bottlenecks.  A little slipshod for sure, but there were
many things that happened that we could not have anticipated when we
were building it.

If your site is so busy that you need to do benchmarking and other
refactoring work, then you have accomplished more than 99% of other
websites out there and deserve a round of applause.  Until then, Just
Build Something, Damnit and worry about fixing any performance issues
later.

Before everyone jumps on me, please understand that I am saying this
out of experience.  Yes, there are certain things you can do in terms
of building a cache-friendly app, or configuring a web server for
optimal use but those are so application-specific I hesitate to
recommend those things until you actually know what you need.  Premature
optimization lies on the path to developer madness.

You won't know what challenges your application will face until people
other than you are actually using it. ;)

Hope that helps.

<p>My new mantra for programming in 2007 is Just Build It, Damnit!  I've been procrastinating too much on several personal projects so it's time to put my money where my mouth is.</p>

            <p>After much digging around on the net, I finally got rallyhat under version control AND using <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">Capistrano</a>.  For the uninitiated, Capistrano is a tool for deploying your application.  It's command-line driven, has hooks in it for version control (I keep my code in a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion repository</a>, and has all sorts of cool little features to it.
</p>

<p>
I found a great <a href="http://blog.digitalduckies.net/articles/2006/10/31/howto-capistrano-deployment-on-media-temples-grid-server/">tutorial on using Capistrano on media temple</a> and then found another link that showed <a href="http://jonathan.tron.name/articles/2006/07/15/capistrano-password-prompt-tips">some tips</a> for dealing with password prompts and such.
</p>

<p>
So now when I do my development work on my laptop, when I'm happy with the code I can push it up onto the live site with a series of commands.  It even allows me to roll stuff back if I have to.  I wish there was a tool this great written in PHP, but luckily you can use it with PHP or any other web-based scripting language.  All Capistrano cares about is that your code is located in the right place.  One of these days I'll put together the deployment script for pushing a PHP app as proof of concept.
