            <p>My 4th gen 20 GB iPod finally gave up the ghost on Thursday.  The first sign?  I kept locking up when I tried to transfer files to it.  So I followed the instructions, removed <a href="http://www.rockbox.org">Rockbox</a> from it and put the original firmware back.  Restored it (according to the Apple instructions again) and everything seemed ok.</p>

<p>Put it kept locking up while uploading files from iTune.  Finally, all it would do is boot up and show me the "folder with an exclamation point" symbol.  Which means the hard drive is fux0rd.  Since I am smart and bought the extended warranty when I got it on Boxing Day 2004 I took it back to Best Buy.  They confirmed my analysis of a borked hard drive and out it goes for repairs.  <strong>Sniff</strong></p>

<p>When Best Buy fixed our digital camera they went down to the last day before they would have to give me a new one and called me to tell me to come and get it.  I'm hoping they won't be able to fix the iPod and that they will have to give me a new one...which means a low-end video iPod.</p>

<p>Of course, I'm never <strong>that</strong> lucky.</p>

            <p>Since I apparantly have tons of free time, I'm helping out an open source project called <a href="http://rephlux.sourceforge.net">Rephlux</a>.  It's a continuous integration environment built for PHP.  Basically, you write SimpleTest unit tests and Rephlux checks out the code, runs the tests and creates reports for those tests.  Ideally, you run it on a seperate machine and it has RSS feeds that report on errors that it finds.</p>

<p>I'm a big believer in testing your code (always do tests for my new stuff) so this seemed like an interesting project to get involved in.  I've been talking with the creator and have already figured out a few tasks to contribute to the project.  Like <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/r00bstat">r00bstat</a>, I'll keep you posted.</p>

            <p>I finally got around to using a gift certificate I'd gotten for my birthday back at the end of March and ordered myself a copy of <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/pad/index.html">Practices of an Agile Developer</a>.  Now, a lot of what is in there is common sense but my experiences have taught me that the forces of fate will toss common sense to the four winds if it can get it's talons embedded.</p>

<p>My eldest daughter (she likes the angel and devil sidebars in the book) asked me why I keep reading all these books.  I tell her it's because I never want to stop learning things, and reading these programming books also helps me to remember best practices for my job.</p>

<p>Until you do something a million times, you fall back on old habits.  But after a while the new habits <strong>become</strong> the old habits.  Yes, I'm an unfocused slacker at times but I do like to do things the right way (at least the right way as I see it).  Agile development practices seem to be the right way to me, but I sure didn't work in an agile development environment before.  Where I am now, I have a chance to put some of those ideas in play.  That makes me feel a lot better about sitting in a cubicle missing my old work buddies.</p>

<p>Pick up a copy of this book and check it out.  There is a lot of really neat information in there that even if you are only able to implement a few of the suggestions you'll be that much further ahead.  If you are going to cherry-pick a few suggestions I highly recommend getting both unit testing and automated integration testing put in place.  Ignore the old-timers and uberslackers who say that testing is lame and a waste of time.  Remind them of that the next time they are fixing a bug in their code that a series of tests would've revealed.</p>
