           <h3>September 27th, 2013</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I had an idea to put together some kind of "PHP Testing Koans" site as a way
to help PHP developers get better at learning how to actually write tests. Most
developers who are introduced to testing get blocked at the point of actually
writing a test. This, in my opinion, has been part of my advocacy that I 
have been struggling to find a good way to teach to people.</p>

<p>So I started to brainstorm ways to make it happen. With some help from <a href="https://twitter.com/jclermont">Joel Clermont</a>
I stumbled upon using test listeners for this.</p>

<p>To be completely fair, I first ran across test listeners when <a href="https://twitter.com/old_sound">Alvfaro Videla</a>
showed me a blog post he had written on how to <a href="http://videlalvaro.github.io/2013/04/using-rabbitmq-in-unit-tests.html">write unit tests for RabbitMQ</a>.
It's a very imaginative use of them, so I wondered if I could bend those test
listeners to my will.</p>

<p>From a high-level view, test listeners in PHPUnit are bits of code designed
to be executed whenever a test suite or individual test is run. For the example
of dealing with RabbitMQ, this makes total sense.</p>

<p>Imagine how happy I was to find that I could use it to determine if a particular
test existed. So how did I do it?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

class Koan1Listener extends PHPUnit_Util_Printer implements PHPUnit_Framework_TestListener
{
    private $expected_tests = array();
    private $found_tests = array();

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this-&gt;expected_tests = array('testHelloWorld');
    }

    public function __destruct()
    {}

    public function startTestSuite(PHPUnit_Framework_TestSUite $suite)
    {
    }

    public function endTestSuite(PHPUnit_Framework_TestSuite $suite)
    {
        foreach ($this-&gt;expected_tests as $test) {
            if (!in_array($test, $this-&gt;found_tests)) {
                throw new Exception("Missing test {$test}");
            }
        }
    }

    public function addError(PHPUnit_Framework_Test $test, Exception $e, $time)
    {}

    public function addFailure(PHPUnit_Framework_Test $test, PHPUnit_Framework_AssertionFailedError $e, $time)
    {}

    public function addIncompleteTest(PHPUnit_Framework_Test $test, Exception $e, $time)
    {}

    public function addSkippedTest(PHPUnit_Framework_Test $test, Exception $e, $time)
    {}

    public function startTest(PHPUnit_Framework_Test $test)
    {
        $test_names = get_class_methods($test);

        foreach ($test_names as $test_name) {
            $this-&gt;found_tests[] = $test_name;
        }
    }

    public function endTest(PHPUnit_Framework_Test $test, $time)
    {}
}

</code></pre>

<p>When you create a listener, you are implementing all the required methods
for <em>PHPUnit_Framework_TestListener</em>. You can see that there are a lot of
them, but in this instance all we needed were <em>endTestSuite</em> and <em>startTest</em>.</p>

<p>The approach is simple: for each test class that gets executed, add the names
of all the methods to an internal list. When the entire test suite is finished,
we then check to see if the test names that we were expecting are in our
list of methods we found. I am sure there is a more efficient way to do it, 
so let me know in the comments of a different approach.</p>

<p>In the case of the example listener, I wanted to make sure that the person
doing the first exercise has a test called <em>testHelloWorld</em> written. As more
koans (or whatever you want to call them) get created, I can use test listeners
to make sure that all the tests, and data providers, and internal class methods
designed to improve code reuse are actually getting written.</p>

<p>Despite all my years of using these tools, I still find things that I didn't 
know about that can be (ab)used to accomplish certain goals.</p>

<p>I hope you find that something you thought you couldn't figure out becomes
possible using test listeners.</p>

           <h3>April 30th, 2013</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As part of a project to migrate the PHP code at <a href="http://synacor.com">work</a>
from PHP 5.2 to PHP 5.4, I'm using our extensive test suite to look for instances
where something that changed between the versions of PHP that we are using
has caused some unexpected behaviour.</p>

<p>In one of our code bases, I found some tests that are exhibiting a test smell
through their use of a try / catch block in the test itself.</p>

<p>Here's a totally-contrived example:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?php
    public function testThatExceptionIsThrown()
    {
        // Use a helper to give us a ready-to-go parser
        $parseHelper = $this-&gt;getHelper('parseHelper');

        /**
         * If we pass a string as the first parameter to parseGrumpyRambling
         * instead of an array, we should get an exception generated because
         * we are using a type hint
         */
        try {
            $weirdCanadianWords = '';
            $phrase = "No doot aboot it, we're gonna win at hockey!";
            $parsedText = $parseHelper-&gt;parseGrumpyRambling(
                $weirdCanadianWords,
                $phrase
            );
            $this-&gt;fail();
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            $this-&gt;assertContains(
                'must be of the type array, string given',
                $e-&gt;getMessage()
            );
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so why does this test offend me so much?</p>

<p>First, I am of the opinion that writing a test to check to make sure you are
enforcing type hinting for your class method parameters is probably not a
good use of your time. I mean, what potential problem are you catching?</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>you likely have access to info about what type of value each parameter
is expected to be</li>
<li>you are probably much better off filtering for parameter type before you
even call that method</li>
</ul>

<p>I can say with confidence that a test like this is returning very little
value for the effort.</p>

<p>Second, putting any logic inside your unit tests is a great way to end
up with unexpected results. Need an "if" statement? Write two tests
for that condition. Need a switch / case? Again, one test per case is a
much better way to logically divide things up.</p>

<p>The worst thing about using try / catch is that <em>PHPUnit gives you two built-in
methods to not ever have to use it</em>. I've had people say to me "but Chris,
if you use try / catch you get much better control over determining where
in the process to test that the exception was thrown." I don't buy it, and
I will try and explain why.</p>

<p>If you are using docblocks on your tests (which you should) it is super easy
to indicate what exception you are expecting to be thrown.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?php
    /**
     * @expectedException Exception
     * @expectedExceptionMessage must be of the type array 
     */
    public function testThatExceptionIsThrown()
    {
        // Use a helper to give us a ready-to-go parser
        $parseHelper = $this-&gt;getHelper('parseHelper');

        /**
         * If we pass a string as the first parameter to parseGrumpyRambling
         * instead of an array, we should get an exception generated because
         * we are using a type hint
         */
        $weirdCanadianWords = '';
        $phrase = "No doot aboot it, we're gonna win at hockey!";
        $parsedText = $parseHelper-&gt;parseGrumpyRambling(
            $weirdCanadianWords,
            $phrase
        );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have a much cleaner-looking test with no conditional logic inside it.</p>

<p>You can also choose to use a built in PHPUnit method to set what exception
you are expecting.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?php
    public function testThatExceptionIsThrown()
    {
        $this-&gt;setExpectedException(
            'Exception',
            'must be of the type array'
        );

        // Use a helper to give us a ready-to-go parser
        $parseHelper = $this-&gt;getHelper('parseHelper');

        /**
         * If we pass a string as the first parameter to parseGrumpyRambling
         * instead of an array, we should get an exception generated because
         * we are using a type hint
         */
        $weirdCanadianWords = '';
        $phrase = "No doot aboot it, we're gonna win at hockey!";
        $parsedText = $parseHelper-&gt;parseGrumpyRambling(
            $weirdCanadianWords,
            $phrase
        );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Again, a much cleaner-looking test with no conditional logic in sight.</p>

<p>On Twitter Brian Fenton shared a <a href="http://www.brianfenton.us/2011/09/bad-practice-setting-expected.html">blog post</a>
he wrote back in 2011 that disagrees with me. In it he very briefly talks about
why you should use try / catch in your tests, but I feel like he is contradicting
himself when he talks about why.</p>

<p>Basically, Brian is concerned about how @expectedException and <em>setExpectedException()</em>
can be triggered by other errors in your tests (including other exceptions
being unexpectedly triggered. He feels that by using try / catch you have
much better control over when and where you wish to trigger an exception.</p>

<p>To quote Brain's post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The basic idea here is that the most specific test is best, because
  you have the least likelihood of a false negative or a test error slipping
  through the cracks."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are making sure that every test is the most specific test that you
can write, then you NEVER have to worry about whether or not some other
code under test is throwing an exception or other error that is messing up
the current test.</p>

<p>Using try-catch because you want to not miss errors that might occur before
you deliberately throw an exception is a sign that you are doing too much
in that test.</p>

<p>A test failure is a test failure, no matter what caused it. The harder you
work to make sure that a test is actually testing the most specific thing
possible, the less likely you have to worry about the things that Brian
feels require him to use try / catch.</p>

<p>This is the same reason I don't like seeing tests like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>do Task A</li>
<li>do an assertion on the results of Task A</li>
<li>do Task B</li>
<li>do an assertion on the results of Task B</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are really two separate tests, so split them up. In fact, you could 
write two tests that look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>do Task A</li>
<li><p>do an assertion on results of Task A</p></li>
<li><p>do Task A</p></li>
<li>do Task B</li>
<li>do an assertion on the results of Task B</li>
</ul>

<p>That second test doesn't need to re-assert that Task A did it's job because
Task A was already covered in the previous test.</p>

<p>Test smells, testing anti-patterns, whatever you want to call them, do exist
and many programmers are often unaware of the consequences of those decisions
are.</p>

<p>Keep your tests small, keep them very specific, and don't use conditional
logic in your tests. I have yet to see a specific example where the use
of conditional logic did anything except reduce the amount of lines of
code a grumpy developer didn't want to type.</p>

           <h3>March 30th, 2013</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>My co-worker <a href="https://twitter.com/chipersoft">Jarvis</a> wrote a blog post
about how he <a href="http://chipersoft.com/p/I-Dont-Care-About-Your-Culture/">doesn't care about your company culture</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know what prompted this blog post, but I disagree with many fundamental
parts of it. Jarvis seems like a decent guy (have only met him online and not
yet in person) but I think Jarvis is making a mistake that many people (not
just software developers) make: thinking that the rest of the world should
think like you when it clearly doesn't.</p>

<p>Initially I was going to make a point-by-point takedown of his blog post, but
halfway through it I realized I was being an asshole. So instead I want to
discuss where I think he's wrong.</p>

<p>I mentioned on Twitter to Jarvis that it's just as important to work on your
co-workers as all the other things you do. He said two interesting things in
response:</p>

<ul>
<li>"This is what I don't like about big companies"</li>
<li>"I work on computers, not people"</li>
</ul>

<p>First, I've worked at places both big and small. There is nothing inherently
better about either type. Do not kid yourself thinking only great things
happen at small companies. Great things happen when groups of smart people
get together and are given permission to go make it happen.</p>

<p>I've seen it work at large places where managers "ran interference" so their
employees could make stuff happen. I've seen small places stifle creativity
in their employees out of fear of change.</p>

<p>It's not the size of the company that matters, it's how they choose to work
together that matters.</p>

<p>The second point is the one where I think Jarvis has made the biggest mistake
in his approach.</p>

<p>We work FOR people USING computers. The computer is a tool
to achieve a goal. Those goals are achieved by working with others, whether
you wish to believe that or not.</p>

<p>As someone who has worked from home for a long time, I understand and
sympathize with many of the things Jarvis indicates that bug him. Noise
from co-workers, drive-by meetings, feeling pressure to participate in
social activities.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, to accomplish anything of substance requires me
to interact with others in REAL TIME. I have proven that I can both get work
done AND not be such an asshole that others choose to ignore the remote
worker instead of working hard to integrate me into the team.</p>

<p>I find that socializing with my co-workers is a good way to learn about the
people I work with, so that when I need something from them later they are
less likely to say "why the fuck should I help that guy?" I need their help
as much as they need mine.</p>

<p>Of course, I don't think this bit at the end helps much:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am extremely productive in this setting. For five years I have cranked out more code in this room than many people have written in their entire careers.</p>
    
    <p>I am exceedingly good at my job and I am sick of being told that my lack of cultural involvement makes me a bad employee.</p>
    
    <p><em>mic drop</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Disrespecting co-workers isn't always the smartest move. Failing to understand
why others think that being aloof and distant and insisting that results matter
more than how you treat people isn't always the smartest move either.</p>

<p>Tech is not a meritocracy, despite our wishes for it to be. Jarvis, you're not
alone in wanting people to just leave you the hell alone so you can get some
work done. I am that way many times, but I make sure to create those bonds
with my co-workers so that the amount of time that I spend with them is
enjoyable instead of resenting the time there.</p>

<p>Nothing creates bonds of friendship like a shitty job, but being friendly with
your co-workers costs you nothing but a little time, time you're probably
spending doing horrible things like reading the comments on Hacker News.</p>
