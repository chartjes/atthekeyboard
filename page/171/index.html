            <p>11:03:17 AM 6161180: One of my personal projects coming up is a PHP5 web framework...prelude to a supersecret open source project
11:04:06 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: oh noes
11:04:08 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: a framework
11:04:31 AM 6161180: Yes, an evil framework
11:04:40 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: 99% of frameworks are
11:04:42 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: evil
11:04:51 AM 6161180: It's a tool to allow me to pimp myself out to various PHP conferences
11:05:00 AM 6161180: "How to build a PHP 5 framework that is not Evil"
11:05:09 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: step 1: download Cake.
11:05:14 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: there is no step 2!
11:05:50 AM 6161180: Cake is not ready
11:06:00 AM 6161180: it doesn't have any frosting yet
11:06:16 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: on the flip side, it mimics the best framework yet. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" />
11:06:27 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: mmm cake. now i'm hungry.
11:06:28 AM 6161180: There is some truth to that
11:06:35 AM 6161180: <strong>rummages around for a snack</strong>
11:06:43 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: the beauty of ruby on rails is how it is loosely coupled
11:06:55 AM 6161180: I dunno...a lot of stuff I do now are exercises to expand my own programming skillz
11:06:58 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: it doesn't make doing things a different way any harder
11:07:11 AM 6161180: maybe it's time I looked at cake closely
11:07:20 AM 6161180: and abandoned my crazy dreams
11:07:39 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: i'm not convinced that php's design as a language really allows the creation of a good framework
11:07:58 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: it's missing a lot of important higher-level language features
11:07:58 AM 6161180: I don't see why not
11:08:03 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: meta-programming's practically impossible 
11:08:20 AM 6161180: what do you mean by "meta-programming" in this instance?
11:08:28 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: writing code which writes code on the fly
11:08:40 AM 6161180: you're talking about the generator scripts?
11:08:45 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: no.
11:08:47 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: let me show you.
11:10:03 AM sp1ffar1ff1c:    {:up =&gt; :move_higher, :down =&gt; :move_lower, :top =&gt; :move_to_top, :bottom =&gt; :move_to_bottom}.each do |action, list_method|
   define_method(action) do
        if params['id']
              @section = Section.find(params['id'])
              @section.send(list_method)
        end
        redirect_to :action =&gt; 'list'
      end
    end<br />
11:10:30 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: this bit of code writes methods when the class is invoked. it's not inside another method, it's just in the class. 
11:10:46 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: the fancy thing is a closure
11:10:57 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: closures + metaprogramming = simplicity
11:11:12 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: it was paul graham who really made me see that ther ereally is a huge power difference between languages
11:11:28 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: he of course pushes lisp, but ruby has most of the features which make lisp great, without the horrible dialects. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" />
11:12:26 AM 6161180: I guess the biggest problem is that PHP grew so fast
11:12:32 AM 6161180: hard to go back after the fact and clean up the mess
11:12:47 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: the biggest problem is that it was made by a guy who hates to program and design things. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" /> php is a sledgehammer.
11:12:51 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: but sometimes you need finer tools
11:13:06 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: it's still the best out there vs eveyrthing but ruby
11:13:07 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: for web dev</p>

           <h3>October 5th, 2005</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Back when I was at the php|works conference, i hooked up for dinner with <a href="http://www.slash7.com">Amy Hoy</a>, who I had met on the #rubyonrails IRC channel.  My other <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/attheballpark">blog</a> uses <a href="http://www.rubyonrails">Ruby on Rails</a> as the underlying technology.  Anyhow, at the time she mentioned there was a supersecret project she had been working on that she couldn't talk about.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I read about <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a>, a site that lets you build what they call "community and social software" applications really easily.  It looks like they host everything for you, and profide an API (PHP only for now) for you to write your own stuff.  Very interesting concept, and I signed up for a beta developer account if only to screw around with it and see what's going on.</p>

<p>When I saw that Amy's <a href="http://www.omniti.com">employer</a> was helping them out, I put one and one together and figured out that this was the project Amy had mentioned.  Congrats to Amy on being involved in something that is very cool (and sure to spawn imitators).</p>

<p>I also chuckled when I saw that they claim you could create your own <a href="http://dating.ning.com">dating site</a>.  C'mon guys, that's sort of half-true.  The site I work on is sitting at 300K+ lines of code.  Maybe that could be ruthlessly cut down to half via refactoring and rewriting, but that is still a lot of code to maintain.  Simple dating site?  Sure.  Money-making dating site?  Can't see it happening the way Ning is currently setup.  Not to say that it couldn't change because, after all, it's still in beta.</p>

<p>Given that Ning is free (and premium stuff is coming that you'll obviously have to pay for) it might be tough to hack together something that you could make money off of.  Hrm...sounds like an interesting programming challenge...</p>
