            <p>A lot of programmers who work with PHP don't even know that you can create shell scripts that run in PHP.  I've used them to pull data from remote servers as part of a work project and are also doing fun things with creating a PHP daemon that runs in the background listening to TCP/IP requests on a specifc port.</p>

<p>Why? I'm writing code that will have to parse the output of a Java client that connects to the <a href=http://www.pa-sportsticker.com/en/index.html>SportsTicker</a> service.  We have plans to create a Flash applet that goes on our forum sites that will present the SportsTicker info in various formats.  SportsTicker spits out XML (which PHP 5 is very good at managing) so my listener simply buffers all the data that comes in and then spits out the XML data to a file that another script will most likely read and modify the info.  I know that Flash can apparantly read in XML data, but who knows if the guy who will be building the Flash component actually knows how to do it.</p>

<p>Here's a sample of the code I've been working on (not the final version obviously) based on a cool tutorial on the Zend site called <a href=http://www.zend.com/pecl/tutorials/sockets/php>Writing Socket Servers in PHP</a>.</p>

while (TRUE) {
    $read[0] = $sock;

    for ($i = 0; $i&lt; $max_clients; $i++) {
        if (isset($client[$i]['sock']) &amp;&amp; $client[$i]['sock'] != NULL) {
            $read[$i + 1] = $client[$i]['sock'];
        }

    $ready = socket_select($read, $write = NULL, $except = NULL, NULL);

    if (in_array($sock, $read)) {

        for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $max_clients; $i++) {

        if (isset($client[$i]['sock']) &amp;&amp; in_array($client[$i]['sock'], $read)) {
            $input = socket_read($client[$i]['sock'], 1024);

            if ($input == NULL) {
                unset($client[$i]);
            }

            $input = trim($input);

            // Now, we add info to the buffer
            $buffer .= $input;

            // Write the data to a file if we have a closing XML tag
            if (stristr($buffer, '&lt;/xml&gt;')) {
                echo $buffer;
                $buffer = "";
            }

        } else {
            if (isset($client[$i]['sock'])) {
                socket_close($client[$i]['sock']);
                unset($client[$i]);
            }

<p>In just about 80 lines you have a working server that listens for requests on a specific port and spits out the data when it thinks you've reached the end.  Once I get a better handle on the actual info coming from SportsTicker (the server that is supposed to run the Java client is having some Java configuration issues that one of our admins is fixing as I type this) then I'm sure I'll put in some error handling and other exceptions.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely happy with the for loop being used to go through all the connections so perhaps I'll spend some time trying to fix it.  If it turns out that I never have more than one connection at a time then I can probably elminate that loop totally, creating some tighter code.  It's never too early to refactor stuff. :)</p>

            <p>...and I'm busy working on my talk "What can PHP Learn From Ruby On Rails".  I've been spending time on my train ride home putting together my magazine article for php|architect magazine on the same issue.  I've got 1500 of the requisite 4000 words done...and are trying to make sure that I'm staying on topic and creating something I will be happy about.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I've got another week or so to get the article done.  It's always an interesting process for me when writing an important document (whether it's a magazine article or a technical specification) as I often turn in stuff that I'm not happy with when I hand it in, but are happy with it when I actually read it after publication.  Too critical?  Maybe.</p>

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2006/07/28/cake-and-ajax/">Cake and AJAX</a></h2>
           <h3>July 28th, 2006</h3>

            <p>Success!  I did manage to get the sortable grid working for the stats reporting system.  It was my first real example of creating an AJAX component for a work project.  It took me quite a while to figure some of the trickier things out.  I did use <a href=http://www.crackajax.net/grid.php>this excellent tutorial</a> to show me a basic example of implementing a sortable grid backed by data pulled from a SQL database.  After that, I found Graham Bird's excellent tutorial on <a href=http://grahambird.co.uk/cake/tutorials/ajax.php>creating an AJAX sortable task list with Cake</a></p>

<p>Now, what I did was a little more complicated because not only did I have to sort by the header columns in the table, I also had date ranges selected via a form <em>and</em> categories selectable via a form to take into consideration.</p>

<p>I can say this:  the AJAX helper functions for CakePHP are just fantastic and spared me from having to figure out all this stuff on my own.  I did have to create some stuff by hand in order to build the following little snipper:</p>

<p>body onLoad = "new Ajax.Updater('hiddenDIV','/verticalscope_stats/reports/getusers/site_name/99', {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, requestHeaders:['X-Update', 'hiddenDIV']}) }, false);"</p>

<p>Yikes.  Not the kind of stuff I want to be building by hand if I can avoid it.  Now, the Cake AJAX helpers use scriptaculous and prototype as the base for their actions.  I found a post in the wiki for Cake complaining about the large size of those two helper libraries, and they do have a point.</p>

<p>The post also turned me on to <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> , which describes itself as "... a Javascript library that takes this motto to heart: Writing Javascript code should be fun. jQuery acheives this goal by taking common, repetitive, tasks, stripping out all the unnecessary markup, and leaving them short, smart and understandable."</p>

<p>I have an idea to try and see if I can take a stab at creating my own Cake helper that uses jQuery instead of the awesome-but-quite-large scriptaculous+prototype combo for the AJAX stuff.</p>

<p>I plan on creating a tutorial on the stuff I did (specifically for implementing a sortable grid in CakePHP) in the next week or so.  It would be nice to share all the stuff I did. :)</p>
