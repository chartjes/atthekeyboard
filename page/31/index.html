           <h3>October 10th, 2011</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Well, I couldn't very well call this post <a href="https://twitter.com/weierophinney/status/122317724117516288">MOAR OFFICE PORN</a> as <a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/">MWOP</a> suggested.</p>

<p>I have talked before on this blog about stuff related to what goes into being a successful remote worker. I've been telecommuting for 4-1/2 years now and it's the best thing that ever happened to my career. It allowed me to grow into the programmer I am today by teaching me the importance of being disciplined, learning how to communicate effectively in a remote environment, and how to not take shit from anyone just because I wasn't in the same office as them. This will be the first article in a series about what I think are some successful strategies for being a good remote worker. Today's lesson is about creating an effective workspace.</p>

<p>When I used to do my killer commute to work every day (1-1/2 hours in, 2 hours out) I had the misfortune of working for employers who did not believe that creative people (yes, that means you mister programmer) needed quiet and private (or at least semi-private) working space in order to get things done. Instead I usually ended up either in the cubicle farm or in that phrase that inspires the most fear for me: the open concept office. Except for the managers of course. They always had offices with doors that could be closed.</p>

<p>So now that you work at home, guess what? You can finally create the environment that will allow you to easily get into that state of focussed work that some refer to as The Zone. No working at coffee shops for this grumpy guy. Small tables, crappy chairs, and people staring at you while you're trying to work. I'm not doing top-secret work for the government, I'm just trying to build some rock-solid web applications. Eyes on your own crappy life, please.</p>

<p>For me, I started off working in the unfinished basement of my house on a make-shift desk that consisted of an old desktop from a broken desk (well, not really broken but I couldn't find a bunch of lock nuts to put it back together after I moved) on top of two filing cabinets. I bought a decent chair (more on that later) and was okay to work. Until it was winter in my part of Canada. The basement was pretty much unheated so by 2 PM my hands were numb.</p>

<p>So at my wife's insistence I moved into the dining room. Almost the same problem as working from the coffee shop, except I had a better chair and no people starting at me. Just the cats, but they never debugged my code properly anyway. Plus she complained about the reproducing paper up the table: bills I paid that hadn't moved down to the filing cabinet in the basement, printouts of instructions and scoresheets for my simulation baseball league. The time came for us to consider trying to use the space in our basement for something productive. So we sank $25K into renovating the basement: laundry room, wreck room for the kids (get the joke?), two storage areas, and a home office for me.</p>

<p>So, what is the configuration that allows me to get into the proper frame of mind to program? Well, the first one is a door that I can close. Call me a princess but sometimes I need to block out the noise from the rest of the house in order to get things done. Especially when the kids are home from school during the last two hours of my normal working day. They argue and make lots of noise when watching TV, so the door gets closed. If I get especially grouchy I lock the door too and make them call me via our phone's intercom system.</p>

<p>I've never liked the idea of putting on headphones to block out the outside world. I find long-term headphone wearing to be hot and uncomfortable. Yes, I used to wear earbuds during my long commute but I wasn't trying to solve any problem other than mentally cooling down from a long day at work. So an office with a door I can close means I can crank up the tunes if required but also give myself a nice quiet zone when I really need it.</p>

<p>Next essential item? Another piece of furniture other than a chair that you can sit on. Until recently all I had was my awesome "fat man chair" (big comfy leather chair that can handle up to 350 pounds of weight). Sometimes I wanted to move away from my desk to work out a problem with paper and pen, or even just to lay down for a minute while talking in a meeting. Hey, don't blame me because I work from home. Make it happen for yourself before picking on me!</p>

<p>Anyway, we recently pulled up the grotty carpet in our house and had laminate flooring installed. I got the people who did the floor to help me move on part of our three-piece sectional down into my office. Now I have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fainting_couch">fainting couch</a> to sit on. Most useful piece of furniture in my office. Do not underestimate the importance of having something else to sit on.</p>

<p>Now, more about the desk. I still have my terrible desk, but with my awesome adjustable chair I have comfort while sitting my large frame down. I'm 6'5", 285 lbs of grumpy programmer. The world is not made for people my size. It was worth the money ($300 at the local office supply place, they had only one in stock) for my chair, so I always recommend people try out several chairs and get the one that the think they could sit in for the longest. Yes, I know that standing desks are all the rage right now, but I think you are trading one set of problems for another. Maybe standings desks work for you.</p>

<p>My next home office purchase will be an adjustable desk from Ikea to get the perfect height for working, as I find my current setup to be just a tad too low. Again, having the ability to adjust the height of your desk to an optimal height based on your chair is critical too. I'd love to fork out the $1500 to get one of those awesome adjustable <a href="http://www.geekdesk.com/">Geek Desks</a> but that will have to wait for me to set aside enough money for purchase and delivery.</p>

<p>So, now my actual working setup. I have a 15" MBP generously purchased for me by my employer. Connected to that I have an Apple keyboard and mouse, and view things via a really nice 23" LCD monitor. What I really want is one of those Apple Studio Displays, but again that will have to wait until I can set aside enough money for such a purchase. Right now, I'd say that is my optimal configuration. I very rarely refer to the laptop screen, and like the amount of real estate I have now. Perhaps I could move to a two-monitor setup but I need more physical space on my desk to make it happen. Hrm, I will have to measure the new desk to see what will fit...</p>

<p>Anyway, in part two I will talk about how my programming style and support tools have changed since I've been working remotely.</p>

        <div>
            <p>I don't regret moving from a Wordpress-powered blog to one that is created using a static site generator. But I can definitely say that the journey
to a static site (initially <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and now using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>) is not a path I would recommend
to anyone who is not comfortable debugging issues from the command line or unable to write conversion tools from scratch depending
on the situation.</p>

<p>While I do like how easy Octopress makes it to manage my blog I find the whole setup to be, like so many other tools and web applications I've come across, to be brittle. Too many moving parts. Too much reliance on things being perfect and if they're off by even the tiniest bit everything falls apart. I am by no means innocent of creating brittle applications but I try and go out of my way these days to create things that are as robust as possible in the constraints of the existing system.</p>

<p>For me it was <a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a>, the "Ruby Version Manager". I like to call it "what <a href="https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> would look like if Ruby guys got their hands on it". On the surface it sounds awesome: it sets up an environment containing the Ruby binary you want and the Ruby gems you want, isolating this application from whatever the defaults were on the system. Just like virtualenv. Sounds incredibly useful. But when it breaks, it breaks and there is NO way to tell what the hell has happened.</p>

<p>Somehow through deleting the .rvmrc file (the RVM config file) I managed to break my install of Octopress. This happened at the same time I upgraded the Octopress components by pulling from the master. I had no fucking idea what had happened, all I knew was that it wouldn't generate any more blog posts for me and was reporting errors about going too many stack levels deep, mal-formed YAML, and Unicode errors. Funny how none of that seemed to have mattered to Octopress before I updated.</p>

<p>In the end, I had to completely remove the install and start it up again from scratch. This is not what I call a successful error-resolution process. In my mind I shouldn't have had to do this at all, but through the removal and re-addition of one file everything was completely messed up. One upside was that in the process of getting things back to "normal" I created two scripts that I hope can be of use to people who ran into the same problems I did.</p>

<p>I used the stock migration script for Jekyll for Wordpress users who had their posts in a database. The script reads all your posts in and then spits out new posts in the Markdown format that Jekyll expects. The new version of Octopress likes Ruby 1.9.2 which, as far as I can tell, is much less forgiving of mistakes in YAML and Unicode characters. I don't use Ruby so I am not as familiar with these issues. It sure sucked when I was searching for solutions to my problems.</p>

<p>So, I had 427 posts that had been converted and there was no way I was going to search through each one by hand to resolve the issues. So I needed two scripts: one to parse all the posts to check for invalid YAML and one to force re-encoding of the content of each post into UTF-8 (because that's how Jekyll and I roll). Being a polygot programming wannabe, the first script for YAML validation was in Python:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import getopt
import os
import re
import sys
import yaml

from yaml import load, dump

try:
    from yaml import CLoader as Loader, CDumper as Dumper
except ImportError:
    from yaml import Loader, Dumper

class Usage(Exception):
    def __init__(self, msg):
        self.msg = msg

def main(argv=None):
    if argv is None:
        argv = sys.argv

    try:
        try:
            print "Checking markdown files in the current directory..."

            #root = "/Users/chartjes/Documents/atthekeyboard/source/_posts"
            for r,d,f in os.walk('.'):
                for file in f:
                    fp = open(file, 'r') 
                    contents = fp.read()
                    marker = "---"
                    a = contents.find(marker)
                    b = contents.find(marker, a + len(marker))
                    try:
                        yaml_to_parse = contents[a:b]
                        yaml.load(yaml_to_parse)
                    except:
                        print "%s is invalid YAML" % file
        except getopt.error.msg:
            raise Usage(msg)
    except Usage, err:
        print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, err.msg
        return 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())

</code></pre>

<p>It took me a while to find some code to extract just the YAML from the posts, and I am not 100% happy with the result but it did the job and identified a handful of posts that made it through the migration and didn't properly wrap post titles with colons (which YAML thinks is bad) in quotes. With the bad YAML fixed I then had to fix any bad characters in the posts. For that I dragged out my copy of "Programming Ruby" (proudly proclaiming on the cover that it was a Second Edition covering Ruby 1.8) and stole some code from a conversion script someone wrote for Wordpress blogs if you dumped the contents as XML.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'fileutils'

markdown_files = Dir["*.yml"]

markdown_files.each do |m|
    puts "Converting #{m}"
    f = File.new(m)
    post_contents = f.read
    content = post_contents.encode("UTF-8")
    new_file = File.new(m + "-new", "w+")
    new_file.write(content)
    FileUtils.mv(m + "-new", m)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said, I'm happy I switched but the brittleness of the whole setup is something I find annoying. I realize that Octopress probably started it's life as one person's set of tools they were using to manage a Jekyll blog. The process of turning that extraction into a general-purpose tool is a difficult one and I want to say thank you to <a href="https://github.com/imathis">Brandon Mathis</a> for providing quick and useful information in the #octopress channel on Freenode while I tried to figure out how to fix the problems I was facing.</p>

<p>(Edit: On Twitter Octopress' creator felt I was <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/imathis/status/113991077555474433">saying that everyone must endure what I went through</a>, which isn't the case. My point was that the whole setup seems fragile to me and that one little mistake shouldn't make everything blow up like it did. Now that I know what to look out for, this shouldn't happen again. Cheer up Brandon!)</p>

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2011/09/13/two-sides-to-api-building/">Two Sides to API Building</a></h2>
           <h3>September 13th, 2011</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I've been spending a lot of time lately building APIs for projects at work. One is a SOAP API and the other an RPC API (no, not full REST but it is aware of GET vs. POST for certain RPC calls). One of them was built to support an internal project (server-side component for a JS-powered online store) while the other is to help a 3rd party extract data from our own services for integration into their own. Building both of these led me to the epiphany (maybe obvious to you but not to me) that there are really two sides to an API. They are not necessarily the sides you are expecting.</p>

<p>One reason to build an API is to expose data that is in your system. If you're really forward-thinking, you wrote the API first and then your applications follow the form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service-Oriented Architecture</a>. That is the sweet spot for a lot of applications and I cannot lie when I say I want to move some of the infrastructure towards that, but I am drifting off topic. This is the most common form of an API -- you select the data you wish to expose to other people. The advanced version of this, which is essential to building an SOA, is to then allow users to do actions via the API that create, update, or delete data in your system.</p>

<p>The second reason to build an API is to allow for integration with other services. Sounds a lot like the first reason for making an API, right? The big difference is that instead of the people building the API (meaning you and/or me) are not in control of what gets exposed. The party doing the integration will be telling you what data they will need exposed. It's a subtle difference but one that I think is important to understand. Under the first scenario, you are in control and (to use a bad cliche) hold the keys to the kingdom, deciding what data gets exposed.</p>

<p>In the second scenario you are not in control and are relying on 3rd parties to tell you what data they need. Depending on the actual relationship between you and the 3rd party, you might have a chance to move this scenario back to the first one. Keep this in mind next time you are building an API and adjust your expectations accordingly.</p>
