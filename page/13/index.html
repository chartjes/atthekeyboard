           <h3>November 18th, 2013</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>At <a href="http://synacor.com">work</a> I have been involved with an effort to put some
automated front-end testing in place. The combination of <a href="http://behat.org">Behat</a>,
<a href="http://mink.behat.org">Mink</a> running tests using <a href="http://phantomjs.org">PhantomJS</a>
is a good one for this. Open source, easy to configure, handles JavaScript-heavy
pages reasonably well.</p>

<p>There was just one wrinkle in our plans: our use of local host files.</p>

<p>Somewhere back in the mists of time it was decided that in order to properly
test our web applications without pummelling our production assets (like
image farms, content servers, API end points) that a "hostfile generator"
would be created and is accessible on every machine in our development VM
network.</p>

<p>You hit <hostname>/hosts and it spits out a file that you can use on your
laptop to alias production assets / resources / whatever to things on your
development server. I use a program on my MacBook called <a href="http://www.clockwise.ee/gasmask/">Gas Mask</a>
that lets me quicky switch between host files when testing out sites on
various development boxes. I am sure a similar tool exists for Windows and
Linux users.</p>

<p>So, initially the only way to make Behat play nicely with the host files was
to manually over-write the /etc/hosts file on the development server with
the host-specific one the generator gives us. That way all the host aliases
in place.</p>

<p>This is fine and all, but I am pretty sure our sysadmins would never allow
the user that runs our continuous integration jobs have the proper permissions
to  overwrite the host files. If a test run were to crash and generate fatal
errors, we would end up with a machine with a bad host file in place.</p>

<p>So clearly what was needed was a proxy. After doing a little bit of digging
around I found a solution: <a href="http://bmp.lightbody.net/">BrowserMobProxy</a>. While
it bills itself as a tool for helping web developers "watch and manipulate
network traffic from their AJAX applications" it also has a feature that
is of great interest to our problem: it supports the ability to create aliases
to hosts...oddly enough just like we do with our host files at work.</p>

<p>So, BrowserMobProxy is great in that you can send requests to REST-style but
I didn't want to mess around with manual calls, so I was happy to find that
my friend <a href="http://element34.ca">Adam Goucher</a> had written a PHP library for
interacting with it. I forked his code, cleaned it up a little and it's
now available via <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/chartjes/php-browsermob-proxy">Packagist</a>
and ready to install via <a href="http://getcomposer.org">Composer</a>.</p>

<p>So, let's get started with what I did.</p>

<p>Here's my composer.json file for the project</p>

<pre><code>{
    "require": {
        "behat/behat": "2.4.*@stable",
        "behat/mink": "1.4@stable",
        "behat/mink-extension": "*",
        "behat/mink-goutte-driver": "*",
        "behat/mink-selenium2-driver": "*",
        "chartjes/php-browsermob-proxy" "dev-master",
        "sauce/connect": "&gt;=3.0",
        "sauce/sasuage": "&gt;=0.5",
    },
    "config": {
        "bin-dir": "bin/"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We are experimenting with using <a href="http://sauce.io">SauceLabs</a> for testing our
sites on mobile devices (in case you were wondering).</p>

<p>With that stuff installed, I next downloaded a copy of BrowserMobProxy (herafter referred to as BMP) and
copied the CLI runner and JAR files into the 'bin' directory. Next, I installed
PhantomJS in /usr/local/bin on my server.</p>

<p>Next, we setup our Behat configuration file to point to PhantomJS when doing
our tests using Selenium2's web driver capabilities:</p>

<pre><code>phantomjs:
    context:
        class: "FeatureContext"
    extensions:
        Behat\MinkExtension\Extension:
            default_session: selenium2
            javascript_session: 'selenium2'
            base_url: http://synacor.com
            selenium2:
                wd_host: http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we get to the tricky part.</p>

<p>BMP requires you to connect to it first to get it to start a
proxy connection running on a <em>different</em> port than the one the main service
runs on. In my Behat test runner script I use the PHP BMP library to create
a connection, and it assigns it to the first available port in a range you
can specify at run time.</p>

<p>Because I can count on this value to be the same all the time, I then start
up an instance of PhantomJS telling it to run in "accept requests like I am
WebDriver compatible" proxy all requests through BMP</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/bin/phantomjs --webdriver=4444 --proxy=http://localhost:9091
</code></pre>

<p>In my Behat context class I add in a step that reads in the host file via
our host file generator and assigns the host aliases to BMP so that when
Behat uses PhantomJS to load web pages, it will use the host aliases set
within BMP.</p>

<p>I know that it's pretty convoluted, but I know with 100% certainty that it
works.</p>

<p>If you spot anything here that doesn't make sense, let me know and I will
update the post.</p>

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2013/10/26/data-providers-and-arrays/">Data providers and arrays</a></h2>
           <h3>October 26th, 2013</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I was asked a question on Twitter by <a href="https://twitter.com/tex_morgan">Tex Morgan</a> 
about a problem he was having with <a href="http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html#writing-tests-for-phpunit.data-providers">PHPUnit data providers</a>. He was trying to pass in some data and kept wondering
why PHPUnit was serializing the data instead of doing what he was expecting.</p>

<pre><code>public function preLoaderArrayDataProvider()
{
    return array("one" =&gt;
        array(
            'http://yahoo.com',
            'http://google.com',
            'http://facebook.com',
            'http://twitter.com'
        ), "two" =&gt;
        array(
            "http://jquery.com",
            "http://jqueryui.com"
        )
    );
}

/** testSetArray
 * @dataProvider   preLoaderArrayDataProvider
 */
public function testSetArray($array)
{
    $this-&gt;expected = true;
    $this-&gt;actual = $this-&gt;object-&gt;setArray($array);
    $this-&gt;assertEquals($this-&gt;expected, $this-&gt;actual);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I see what Mr. Morgan was trying to do, and more importantly why it wasn't
working. The problem he was running into has to deal with how PHPUnit expects
data to be sent by the data providers.</p>

<p>The method under test is expecting one parameter that consists of an array.
Data providers are supposed to return an array of arrays, where each element
of the inner array maps to a parameter the method under test is expecting.</p>

<p>So what went wrong? The data provider is passing in 5 strings as a parameter.
Here's the results:</p>

<pre><code>PHPUnit 3.7.28 by Sebastian Bergmann.

FF

Time: 28 ms, Memory: 2.50Mb

There were 2 failures:

1) TexTest::testSetArray with data set "one" ('http://yahoo.com', 'http://google.com', 'http://facebook.com', 'http://twitter.com')
Failed asserting that false matches expected true.

/Users/chartjes/src/php-test-bootcamp-practice/tests/TexTest.php:29

2) TexTest::testSetArray with data set "two" ('http://jquery.com', 'http://jqueryui.com')
Failed asserting that false matches expected true.

/Users/chartjes/src/php-test-bootcamp-practice/tests/TexTest.php:29

FAILURES!
Tests: 2, Assertions: 2, Failures: 2.
</code></pre>

<p>The fix is easy. The method under tests is expecting one parameter that is an
array, so let's give it one.</p>

<pre><code>public function preLoaderArrayDataProvider()
{
    return array("one" =&gt;
        array(
            array(
                'http://yahoo.com',
                'http://google.com',
                'http://facebook.com',
                'http://twitter.com'
            )
        ), "two" =&gt;
        array(
            array(
                "http://jquery.com",
                "http://jqueryui.com"
            )
        )
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The result?</p>

<pre><code>PHPUnit 3.7.28 by Sebastian Bergmann.

..

OK (2 tests, 2 assertions)

<p>Problem solved. Hope this helps you give a better understanding of how
PHPUnit data providers work.</p>

        <div>
            <p>If you follow me online at all you are probably aware that I help organize
<a href="http://truenorthphp.ca">TrueNorthPHP</a>, a PHP-centric conference for developers.
This is the second time I've helped out, and I have been watching with a mixture
of horror and fear how social media networks are filling up with tales of
excessive alcohol consumption and sexual assaults of female attendees at
conferences.</p>

<p>I know people hate talking about this sort of stuff, but I am keenly aware
of the ridiculous amount of privilege I have in this society. White, male,
over 40, heterosexual, married, well-paid, working in technology. Some of
this has been earned, much of it just handed to me.</p>

<p>As I briefly <a href="https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer/status/389825655460073472">mentioned on Twitter</a>
my goal is to try and create an environment where people can meet and find
common ground. Sure, there will always be assholes who wreck if for you.
Sometimes those assholes are the conference organizers themselves. Ultimately,
the responsibility for the attendees feeling wanted, engaged and safe belongs
to the organizers.</p>

<p>As I see it, there are two major concerns for a conference organizer in late
2013: too much alcohol makes people uncomfortable, and harassment of women
by attendees. I wanted to share my thoughts on both.</p>

<p>I intend on enforcing a zero-tolerance-for-bullshit-behaviour policy at the conference.
This includes harassing people based on gender, sexual preference, country of
origin. In short, if you act like an asshole and I find out, chances are you
will be escorted out personally with no refund. It's not hard to avoid acting
in an unacceptable way, and never mind your own incorrect opinions on free
speech and the consequences that come with it.</p>

<p>It's a shame that I have to say things like this to other adults, because I 
would prefer to trust people to know what is acceptable in such an environment.</p>

<p>Second, clearly, there is an alcohol problem in general at conferences. There
is a huge cultural component to it (bros want to slam down the brewskis) and
many people who do not drink alcohol (for whatever reason) are made to feel
uncomfortable with not drinking it. The cheers when people hear that there
is an open bar, the jokes about people not attending talks on the second day
because they are hungover. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.</p>

<p>In a culture where drinking, often to excess, is acceptable to a large percentage
of the population, this is very tough battle. Personally, I am looking to offer
free alcohol at the conference but in very limited amounts. The conference venue
doesn't allow any on-site alcohol so your only chance to have a drink on me 
is at our party on the Saturday. Which is at a bar near the venue.</p>

<p>If you don't drink alcohol, come and sit with me at the restaurant and I will
make sure you are welcomed and not uncomfortable. I don't need to drink alcohol to
socialize with my friends and peers, and neither will you. Being with a bunch
of strangers is intimidating enough without feeling pressure to conform.</p>

<p>Third, people still have the attitude that computer programming should be one
big sausage party. Women are expected to "know their place" and go along
with all the crude humour and intimidating behaviour that those who think
women are inferior are supposed to just endure with a smile. When I see
comments like "you're encroaching on a safe place for males" it makes me
want to physically confront them about their incredibly wrong ideas.</p>

<p>I worked hard to attract women speakers who would provide interesting content
to my conference. Did things go as well as I thought they could? No, it never
does. I could've worked harder to seek out more talented women speakers, but
there is only so much time and the list of things a conference organizer
has to think about is long.</p>

<p>Any female attendees for TrueNorth can feel comforted that I will be 100%
approachable and 100% on your side should you be subject to any objectionable
behaviour by any attendee. As the father of two girls, I already see the 
bullshit they are being asked to put up with simply because of their gender.
I won't go along with letting it happen to you.</p>

<p>If you come to our Saturday social and are feeling uncomfortable, again, join
me at my table and I will work my hardest to make sure you are as comfortable
as I will be.</p>

<p>Last year, the conference was awesome and I didn't hear any complaints. That
doesn't mean things didn't happen, and part of me wonders if many suffered in
silence because they thought complaining wouldn't change anything.</p>

<p>I want you to enjoy yourselves at TrueNorthPHP, with an
understanding that binge-drinking and harassment of attendees is something
that will absolutely not be tolerated or promoted by the organizers.</p>

<p>The goal is to spend 2 days learning and sharing things about PHP and related
technologies, while also having a good time in an environment where you should
expect to be looked after and feel safe.</p>

<p>Don't hesitate to track me down and ask me about ANYTHING while at the 
conference. I am here to help you.</p>
