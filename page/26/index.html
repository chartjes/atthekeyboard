            <h2><a href="/2012/02/22/thoughts-on-testing-apis/">Thoughts on testing APIs</a></h2>
           <h3>February 22nd, 2012</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I have been asked a few times on Twitter for some advice on how to use
testing tools in order to test APIs. It just so happens that I am writing a
bunch of tests for an API at work so perhaps this is a very timely blog post.
Rather than show you exactly what I did (I'm using <a href="http://behat.org">Behat</a>)
I wanted to discuss some common strategies I use when contemplating testing
APIs.</p>

<p>When you are testing an API you main concern is your ability to reproduce
the results of a specific API call. If your API is such that repeating a
call several times will give you different results, you do have some 
challenges on your hands.</p>

<p>Testing that an API just works is what I would call a functional test. At
the highest level you are saying "will this call actually work". Since you
will be actually making API calls in your tests they can take quite some
time to run depending on how many you have. Long-running tests are the
type of tests that really should be forming the last line of defense just
before you're about to go into production.</p>

<p>Why? Functional tests have a lot of moving parts: HTTP calls, request and
response parsing, and likely communications with some sort of data store.
Not exactly the types of things that lead you to having a test suite that
can run in 10 seconds or less.</p>

<p>In my opinion the only way to have really effective functional tests is
by making sure that the API endpoints you are testing are using a known 
data source, one that will not be altered by your tests. That
way it will be easy to verify that a particular call had the expected
response. Remember, at the most basic level testing is about repeatedly
verifying that your code is returning an expected result.</p>

<p>If you are testing someone else's API, I hope there is a test mode or a 
sandbox that you can use. A lot of APIs are rate-limited or only allow a
limited number of requests a day (I'm looking at you, Google Analytics). 
The last thing you want is for your application to longer be able to access an
API because you went nuts testing things. Remember, the goal of functional 
tests in this scenario are to make sure that the API is returning results
that you expect, nothing more.</p>

<p>Integration tests of APIs are a bit of a tricky thing to do in an effective
way. Sometimes 3rd party APIs change. Sometimes you are also lucky enough
to be told ahead of time that it's happening. If your application relies
heavily on 3rd party APIs then your integration tests are a key line of
defense. While tests like these shouldn't be run as much as the unit
tests for the API, they should be run before a production push. Nobody
likes their application to be broken because of an unannounced change to
an API.</p>

<p>Finally, we have tests designed to make sure that your application is 
correctly handling the results of API calls. To make these sorts of tests work, 
you will end up either creating mock
objects of the code that will do the calls or data fixtures representing 
results of API calls. It is also for this reason I always recommend wrapping
the calls to an API in code, just so you can mock them for testing purposes.
Sure, it might be easier to cheat and do file&#95;get&#95;contents() on a URL but
that approach is pretty difficult to test.</p>

<p>Remember, these tests should not even be calling out to an API in order to
work. Mocks and data fixtures are supposed to provide that data. All you
are doing is testing the code that needs results from the API. Again, if
you have been building your application with testability in mind your
suite of unit tests should be blazing fast.</p>

<p>In the end, it doesn't really matter what tools you are using to test either
your own APIs or ones that your application depends on. Be clear in your
mind about what it is you are actually trying to accomplish and don't get
create tests that provide very little value to your application.</p>

            <h2><a href="/2012/02/14/organizing-slim-framework-apps/">Organizing Slim Framework Applications</a></h2>
           <h3>February 14th, 2012</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Influenced by discussion with <a href="https://twitter.com/funkatron">Ed</a> I have
decided to use <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a> as the framework
for a PHP application I am building that is an addition to what is found
on the web site for the <a href="http://www.ibl.org">simulation baseball league</a> I
have belonged to for 14 seasons. I've never really used a microframework
in PHP before. I used <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> for a Python
<a href="https://github.com/chartjes/liesitoldmykids">project</a> that I did to experiment
with using Google App Engine. The principles seem to be quite similar 
(although I will admit that having decorators in PHP would be ineresting)
but the trade-off with a microframework is that you usually have to figure
out an application layout for yourself.</p>

<p>I decided to use the following things for this app:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slim (using latest stable version, 1.5.0 at this writing)</li>
<li><a href="http://pimple.sensiolabs.org">Pimple</a> as a dependency injection container</li>
<li><a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org">Twig</a> for a templating engine</li>
</ul>

<p>I also decided to use <a href="http://packagist.org/about-composer">Composer</a> as a way
to install the above dependencies. Slim is not in <a href="http://packagist.org">Packagist</a>
so I was forced to do a little reorganizing work after getting some help in
IRC from <a href="https://twitter.com/jakefolio">Jake Smith</a>. Here's what I did to get
all three of those things playing nicely together with Composer's autoloader:</p>

<ul>
<li>moved the directory that contains Slim into the vendor directory</li>
<li>altered vendor/.composer/autoload&#95;namespaces.php to look for Slim</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>// autoload_namespace.php generated by Composer

$vendorDir = dirname(__DIR__);

return array(
    'Twig_Extensions_' =&gt; $vendorDir . '/twig/extensions/lib/',
    'Twig_' =&gt; $vendorDir . '/twig/twig/lib/',
    'Pimple' =&gt; $vendorDir . '/pimple/pimple/lib/',
    'Slim' =&gt; $vendorDir .'/slim/slim'
);
</code></pre>

<p>I've come to the opinion that if you are using a tool that provides an autoload
you are probably better off using the one they provide rather then trying to make
those two co-exist. I'm sure I could've used the autoloader from the <a href="http://phix-project.org">Phix project</a>
but I didn't feel like screwing around with it. The composer one works and it was
easy to tell it to use Slim. Once I start creating the models that I will use for 
this application I will add their location to that file too.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, it came time to discuss how to actually organize this
application. I have a templates directory for my Twig templates, which totally
makes sense. But what to do with the index.php file that Slim relies on. Like
any front-controller-driven application all our requests, after being folded
and mutilated by a web server rewrite rule, go through index.php. In the sample
Slim app they have something like this in their index.php file:</p>

<pre><code>$app = new Slim();
$app-&gt;get('/hello/:name', function ($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
});
$app-&gt;run();
</code></pre>

<p>This might be all Kool and the Gang if you only have a bunch of really small 
actions. This app will be interacting with models a lot, and I'm positive that
despite my best efforts to roll with a "fat models, skinny controllers" paradigm
that some of those actions will end up being lots of code. Smashing all that stuff
together in one file strikes me as an abomination against best coding practices.
Ed told me how the <a href="http://fictivekin.com/">FictiveKin</a> folks are organizing their
Slim apps, so I have created something similar to it.</p>

<p>All my routes are going to go into a routes directory and then I will
specifically include the routes I want via require calls. One route per file and
I will try and name them something sensible.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

require './bootstrap.php';

// Load all our routes
require './routes/main.php';
require './routes/hello.php';

$app-&gt;run();
</code></pre>

<p>Inside each one of these files will be an app->get|post|whatever call</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$app-&gt;get('/', function() {
    echo 'MAIN PAGE';
});
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, that default route sucks but getting the structure in place was more 
important to me than having something useful stubbed out.</p>

<p>I'm sure there is more than one way to organize a Slim application, but this
is one that I think works best for me.</p>

            <h2><a href="/2012/02/13/baby-steps-with-node-js/">Baby Steps with Node.js</a></h2>
           <h3>February 13th, 2012</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>In a desire to stay relevant, I have been spending some time taking a look
at <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>. Why? I believe it is always a good idea
to take a look at whatever the new hawtness is, if only to evaluate it's
suitability for use within your own applications. Sometimes it is also
a good idea to see if you can wrap your brain around it.</p>

<p>So I went and bought a good <a href="http://leanbundle.com/b/node/">bundle of ebooks about Node</a>
and started going through the tutorial code. These two seemed like a good
place to start: an introductory tutorial and then another book that leaps
right into things with the aim of really giving you some hands-on work with
Node.</p>

<p>The crowning glory of my early work is this bit of code from a tutorial that
emits events and then allows you to react to them:</p>

<pre><code>var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
var util = require('util');

var Ticker = function(){};

util.inherits(Ticker, EventEmitter);

Ticker.prototype.tick = function() {
    self = this;
    interval = setInterval(function() {
        self.emit('tick');
    }, 1000);
};

var myTicker = new Ticker();

myTicker.on('tick', function() {
    console.log('TICK');
});

myTicker.tick();
</code></pre>

<p>Now I realize that this code sample is something very trivial but I also
think it shows what someone who has mostly worked in languages without
callbacks is up against when they start using node.</p>

<p>As a PHP guy I am used to my code being executed pretty much in the order
that you read it when looking at the source code: from top to bottom, with
jumps out to other code as required but always returning to this flow.</p>

<p>Once you start getting into callbacks and other evented paradigms it becomes
a lot more difficult to intuitively figure out what's going on. Note that
I said "intuitively" because I'm sure that to anyone past the beginner
stage with Node would understand what is going on there.</p>

<p>There is a lot that looks familiar though. We have the importing of modules
via require statements. I also think this a good point to mention the
outstanding job that <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a> does in helping to manage
dependencies. I used to think that the <a href="http://rubygems.org">Ruby gems</a> system
was one that should be aspired to. If you're going to ignore <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>
that is.</p>

<p>Then I create what I can only describe as an empty object, and then we
say that our Ticket object is going to inherit whatever is in EventEmitter.
Okay, so far so good in terms of familiar territory.</p>

<p>Next we have the block of code that lets us create a tick method for our
overall Ticker object, and this is done with a callback. We have scoping
issues to deal with (hence the self = this line) and we are creating something
that will emit a 'tick' event once a second (1000ms). That looks a little
weird if you're not used to callbacks, and we even have an anonymous function
inside an anonymous function.</p>

<p>After that we then grab a Ticker object, tell it that every time there is a
'tick' event detected we want to log TICK to the console. Finally, we tell
it to run myTicker.tick() and then it goes on it's way emitting TICK once a second.</p>

<p>That's not such a mind bender once you break it down the way I did. But what about
this type of thing:</p>

<pre><code>var fs = require('fs');

fs.open('./a.txt', 'a', function(err, fd) {
    var writeBuffer = new Buffer('7');
    var bufferOffset = 0;
    var bufferLength = writeBuffer.length;
    var filePosition = 10;

    fs.write(fd, writeBuffer, bufferOffset, bufferLength, filePosition, function(err, written) {
        if (err) {
            throw err;
        }

        console.log('wrote ' + written + ' bytes');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>We all know that it is easy to write spaghetti code in PHP because of the fact
that it grew up on the web: it was a templating language with C library 
wrappers. Very easy to just mash everything together. I see the same sort of
spaghetti possibilities there in Node, with the added bonus of callbacks
being mixed in there to make certain things difficult.</p>

<p>I understand what I did there: I am opening a file and then writing to it. The
way that I got to do it made me scratch my head. Writing to the file happens
as a callback that is executed as a result of opening up the file for
appending? Like I said before, that does not strike me as very intuitive
for programmers coming to Node with a little understanding of Javascript
and jQuery, which is probably most programmers' introduction to anonymous
functions.</p>

<p>But I do get it. You cannot get non-blocking IO without doing such gyrations
but I am concerned that sufficiently large Node applications will be, to put
it bluntly, a fucking nightmare to debug. Is this something that cannot be
moved away from if you choose to write programs using tools that suppoort
concurrency and/or evented concepts?</p>

<p>I'd love to hear what sort of best practices people are using in order to
tame the potential for Node applications degenerating into spaghetti hell.</p>
