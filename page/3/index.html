        <div>
            <p>(If you use PHP, you can learn how to write automated tests for your code via my <a href="https://leanpub.com/c/learntotest">"Learn To Test Like A Grumpy Programmer" course</a> over at LeanPub)</p>

<p>In this blog post I wanted to talk about some of the lessons I've
learned at the <a href="https://mozilla.com">day job</a> about how to use tools and techniques
we are familiar with in the developer world to make our job of
testing things easier.</p>

<h2 id="mozilla%27s-push-notification-service">Mozilla's Push Notification Service</h2>

<p>One of the projects I do QA work for is the <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox">push notification service</a>
that Mozilla runs. Yes, I know a lot of people get supremely annoyed
by push notifications. Yes, they are heavily abused by people. Mozilla
tries to use them in a way not designed to annoy you. But this is the
Internet after all, where everything annoys somebody somehow.</p>

<p>My work for that team involves doing testing of the service whenever
a new version is ready to be released. The process goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>the development team tags a new release along with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog">changelog</a></li>
<li>the operations team deploys this new release to the staging environment</li>
<li>I create a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">BugZilla</a> ticket to track the deployment and testing results</li>
<li>I run a series of tests against the service on staging, recording my progress there</li>
</ul>

<p>If all my tests pass on staging, I give approval to deploy that version
of the service to production. The process for that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>the operations team deploys the new release to production</li>
<li>I create another ticket to track the deployment process and testing results</li>
<li>I run the same tests and add an additional set of load tests to make sure the service is responsive</li>
</ul>

<p>So what tests do I run?</p>

<h2 id="api-contract-tests">API Contract Tests</h2>

<p>I wrote some tests using <a href="https://pytest.org">pytest</a> that make API
calls using known values and verify that we are getting the responses
that we expect.</p>

<p>These tests usually are not difficult to write and I did experiment
with making them asynchronous using <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio">pytest-asyncio</a>
so I could learn how asynchronous code works in Python. If you had
a very large test suite, I could see it being useful to speed up the
process. This particular test suite is not big enough to warrant that.</p>

<p>For my fellow PHP folks, there are some plugins for <a href="https://phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a>
that can run your tests in parallel. For one example check out <a href="https://github.com/jwage/phpchunkit">PHPChunkit</a></p>

<h2 id="load-tests">Load Tests</h2>

<p>I only run the load tests on the production version of the service because
the number of nodes that handle push notification requests is higher in
production. These tests are designed to put some non-trivial load onto
the system and examine the output from the nodes for any error messages.</p>

<h2 id="vapid-testing">VAPID Testing</h2>

<p>I use two different Android devices for these tests. Each device has
latest stable and nightly releases of Firefox on them. One device
is configured to point at staging, the other at production.</p>

<p>A web page is loaded that uses Javascript to generate <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/services/2016/08/23/sending-vapid-identified-webpush-notifications-via-mozillas-push-service/">VAPID-based notifications</a>.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2018 I did experiment with seeing if I could automate
these tests so I could use an online service offering cloud-accessible
Android images. I did make some progress but it seems like some of the
pieces needed to do things like make sure I don't have to click on the
browser to accept notifications are either really brittle or don't exist,
depending on what automation tools you are using.</p>

<h2 id="desktop-notification-tests">Desktop Notification Tests</h2>

<p>The person who did this testing work before me created a Nodejs app that
serves up an web page with some forms and buttons on them. You fill in
some values and it creates a series of push notifications that you
visually verify work. He then put it inside a Docker container to make
it easier for others to run those tests.</p>

<p>This test used to be on a personal web page of a (now-former) Mozilla
employee.</p>

<h2 id="desktop-webpush-tests">Desktop WebPush Tests</h2>

<p>These tests are to make sure that a feature of the service where you
can group WebPush messages together by topic, only displaying the last one,
works correctly.</p>

<p>The process for these tests are:</p>

<ul>
<li>checkout a <a href="https://github.com/jrconlin/topics">GitHub repo</a> that contains the test</li>
<li>configure everything according to the documenation</li>
<li>start up the "topic server" via the CLI, which is serving up a one-page <a href="https://cyclone.io">Cyclone</a> web application</li>
<li>click on a button fire up a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">service worker</a> that receives requests to send a WebPush notification</li>
<li>then use another CLI tool to fire off notifications (with or without a topic)</li>
<li>visually verify that the notifications appeared</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that I already had a Docker-based solution, I decided it was time
to turn this test into something where I only have to click a few buttons
instead of running things via the CLI.</p>

<p>The first step was to update the existing one page app to have two more
buttons. So I edited the HTML to add some buttons and then added some
JavaScript that made calls to two new URL's for the app.</p>

<p>I then added those two URL's to the Cyclone app, porting over code from
the CLI "topic pusher" tool to generate the notifications.</p>

<p>There was already a Dockerfile for the application, so I used that and
then spent some time building and rebuilding and debugging the application
to make sure it did actually make it so all I had to do was the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>download the Docker image</li>
<li>start running the image (making sure to tell Docker to forward the correct port)</li>
<li>click on the Subscribe button and see the message that the service worker is running and the browser asks to accept notifications</li>
<li>click on the button that sends a single notification and visually verify output</li>
<li>click on the button that sends multiple notifications grouped by topic and visually verify output</li>
</ul>

<p>So now I have a test that I can point other folks to that they can
use without having to install any dependencies in their local environment
other than a web browser and Docker.</p>

<h2 id="programming-skills-%2B-qa-work-%3D%3D-solving-interesting-problems">Programming Skills + QA work == Solving Interesting Problems</h2>

<p>I am far from the only person who has this skill set. But having
some ability to create your own purpose-specific tools means
that the people around you get to benefit.</p>

<p>Often the tools (and automation solutions) that folks use to
test things are proprietary and not open to be modified. So
you expend a lot of energy trying to bend a tool towards a
new purpose.</p>

<p>There are other folks out there like me who busy creating wrappers
around hard-to-use tools or creating new solutions with the
goal of making what used to be difficult a lot easier. Encourage
those people and promote what they are doing!</p>

        <div>
            <p>(You can see more stuff like this blog post if you buy my <a href="https://leanpub.com/c/learntotest">"Learn To Test Like A Grumpy Programmer" course</a> over at LeanPub)</p>

<p>I wanted to show folks how someone who has been writing tests for PHP in anger
since 2003 actually implements new features for a web site, driving them with
tests.</p>

<p>More importantly, I want you to focus on how deliberate and methodical I am
in doing this work. I know it's an overused word, but discipline is a key
factor in successfully using a TDD approach for your tests. Skipping steps or
taking short cuts is a great way to end up with weird errors that you spend
a very long time debugging.</p>

<p>I am building [OpenCFP Central])(https://opencfpcentral.com), which is a companion
web application for <a href="https://github.com/opencfp/opencfp">OpenCFP</a>. OpenCFP is
a PHP web application that conference organizers can install and use to collect
talk submissions from prospective speakers.</p>

<p>OpenCFP Central is a 100% free service.</p>

<p>Right now you can register for an account with OpenCFP Central. For conference
organizers, you can obtain OAuth tokens so that people can use their OpenCFP Central
account to login and submit talk ideas to OpenCFP. This helps to reduce one of
the biggest complaints, which was "why do I have to keep creating OpenCFP accounts?!?"</p>

<p>The next feature I am building is allowing OpenCFP Central users to create talks and
store them there. Once I've built that out, then I will add functionality to OpenCFP
itself to retrieve a list of talks for a user who authenticated using OpenCFP Central
and allow one-click submission of the talk to that OpenCFP instance.</p>

<p>OpenCFP Central is being built using <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> starting with
version 5.7. This is my first Laravel app but so many of the concepts it presents
are not revolutionary or even unexpected for folks who have been doing web
development with these "front controller style" web application frameworks.</p>

<p>So, with all that out of the way, let me show you how I implemented the first
bit of functionality of the new feature: displaying an empty talk creation
form for an authenticated user.</p>

<p>I started with a test that assumed everything was working:</p>

<pre><code class="php">namespace Tests\Feature\Feature;

use App\User;
use Tests\TestCase;

class TalkPage extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * @test
     */
    public function it_displays_the_talk_form()
    {
        /**
         * As a logged-in user
         * When I follow the route for "click here to create a talk"
         * I should see the talk form being displayed
         */
        $user = Factory(User::class)-&gt;create();
        $response = $this-&gt;actingAs($user)
            -&gt;get(route('create_talk'));
        $response-&gt;assertStatus(200);
        $response-&gt;assertSeeText('Create A Talk');
        $response-&gt;assertSeeText('Title');
        $response-&gt;assertSeeText('Description');
        $response-&gt;assertSeeText('Other Details');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, it failed because I did not have the route created. So I went and
added this route to <code>routes/web.php</code></p>

<pre><code class="php">Route::get('/talk/create', 'TalkController@create')-&gt;name('create_talk');
</code></pre>

<p>Now the test fails because I don't have a TalkController. I used the <code>artisan</code>
CLI tool to create an empty TalkController and modified it to use the <code>auth</code>
middleware.</p>

<pre><code class="php">namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Illuminate\View\View;

class TalkController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Create a new controller instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this-&gt;middleware('auth');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The test fails because I do not have the expected method for <code>TalkController</code>
created yet. Let's add that in:</p>

<pre><code class="php">namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Illuminate\View\View;

class TalkController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Create a new controller instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this-&gt;middleware('auth');
    }

    /**
     * Show the application dashboard.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\View\View
     */
    public function create(): View
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Test still failing (as expected) because it's not doing anything.
I'll add some code where I grab our authenticated user and ask
it to display a specific view.</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Illuminate\View\View;

class TalkController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Create a new controller instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this-&gt;middleware('auth');
    }

    /**
     * Show the application dashboard.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\View\View
     */
    public function create(): View
    {
        $user = Auth::user();
        return view('talk.create')
            -&gt;with('user', Auth::user());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the test fails because that view does not exist. I need to
create the appropriate directory structure to group views related
to talks and create a blank one that uses our existing layout.</p>

<pre><code class="php">@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;div class="row justify-content-center"&gt;
            &lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;
                &lt;div class="card"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="card-header"&gt;Create A Talk&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;
                            Use the form below to create a talk that can be submitted to OpenCFP instances that are
                            using OpenCFP Central
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
@endsection
</code></pre>

<p>Test still fails because there is no form information in there. So I created
a partial view that contains the form fields I want. I did it without the
opening and closing form tags because I plan on reusing this form snippet
elsewhere. As part of a future test I need to modify this snippet to 
set default values as part of verifying you can actually succesfully
create or update a test. Sometimes it's okay to think a little bit ahead.
This strikes me as a very minor detail.</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
    &lt;label for="talk_title"&gt;Title&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" name="talk_title" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
    &lt;label for="description"&gt;Description&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;textarea class="form-control" name="talk_description"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
    &lt;label for="other"&gt;Other Details&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;textarea class="form-control" name="talk_other"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Next I updated the main "create talk" view to use this form and wrapped
it form tags that POST the results to another method.</p>

<pre><code class="php">@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;div class="row justify-content-center"&gt;
            &lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;
                &lt;div class="card"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="card-header"&gt;Create A Talk&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;
                            Use the form below to create a talk that can be submitted to OpenCFP instances that are
                            using OpenCFP Central
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;form method="post" action="/talk/create"&gt;
                                @csrf
                                @include('talk.form')
                                &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Create Talk&lt;/button&gt;
                            &lt;/form&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
@endsection

<p>Now the test passes!</p>

<p>I hope this blog post helps you understand what a TDD flow with an app under
real conditions looks like.</p>

        <div>
            <p><a href="https://grumpy-learning.com/grumpyconf2019.php">GrumpyConf 2019</a> will mark
the 7th conference I've been involved in running:</p>

<ul>
<li>CakeFest in Orlando, Florida, USA in 2008</li>
<li>TrueNorthPHP in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada from 2012 until 2016</li>
<li>GrumpyConf in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada starting in 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>As I helped organize these events, I quickly came to understand that the role
of sponsors is to help offset the costs of running these events. In exchange,
you promise to give them access to your attendees in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>keynotes/talks/hackathons related to their products</li>
<li>booths or tables for outreach</li>
<li>paying for meals and/or snacks</li>
<li>swag to give to attendees and sometimes speakers</li>
</ul>

<p>I have never been shy about asking for sponsorship of my events because 
they are expensive to run and I have certain ideas and standards I want
to stick to.</p>

<p>But what do you do when the normal ways you have to reward sponsors aren't
available? This is the dilemma I face with GrumpyConf.</p>

<p>The idea of GrumpyConf is to have a small event at a somewhat isolated
location and set up conditions where the attendees mingle with speakers
who have experience solving tough problems and have great personal skils.
If you're looking for an event that will show you a path to "levelling up"
your skills to further your career, this is the one for you.</p>

<p>The event is not cheap because it's at a <a href="http://www.elmhurstinn.com/">nice resort</a>
and the ticket includes three nights' stay and meals. Plus I pay my speakers'
travel expenses and hotel. So I set the prices to make sure I could break
even if the same number of folks come who did last year. It's entirely
funded out of my pocket through ticket sales and whatever other expenses I
need to cover. As long as I don't have to put a lot of my own money into
the event, I can continue to run it. I am not a charity and will not run
an event at any kind of substantial loss.</p>

<p>I would love sponsorship of my event to defray the costs of my speakers.
But I am at a lost to figure out what I can give these generous sponsors
in exchange for their money.</p>

<p>If you are interested in sponsoring GrumpyConf 2019, please get in touch
with me. My contact information is in the sidebar (on desktop) or all the
way at the bottom in mobile versions.</p>
