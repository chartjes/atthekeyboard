           <h3>November 7th, 2011</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>One of the interesting side effects of getting involved in your programming
language community of choice is that you often get access to cool projects
being done by your community buddies before the rest of the riffraff (aka 
the general public). One such project is <a href="http://gimmebar.com">Gimme Bar</a>,
a "capture anything you want and read later" web site. Created by the fine
folks at <a href="http://fictivekin.com/">Fictive Kin</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/coates">Sean Coates</a>
and <a href="http://twitter.com/funkatron">Ed Finkler</a> were kind enough to not only
give me access to their application (My user type apparantly is "The Betanaut") but
also an early peek at their API.</p>

<p>Now, it's changed a bit since their earliest work but now they are starting to promote
not only the site but showing how easy it is to use their API to play around with
not only your content but other's public-facing content too. I fooled around with
the API and tried to write some Python stuff but lots patience when trying to work
with OAuth from the command line. Hey, it's not their fault that I couldn't be bothered
to slog through it all.</p>

<p>Funkatron was kind enough to put together a blog post about <a href="http://funkatron.com/posts/building-a-tumblelog-with-gimme-bar-and-php.html">building a Tumblelog with 
Gimmer Bar and PHP</a>
so I told him I would write up what I did on my own blog.</p>

<p>One of my intents was to use the <a href="https://gimmebar.com/api/v0">Gimme Bar API</a> to pull
in a list of my latest Gimmies for the sidebar on this blog. Ed had posted a very
simple example in Javascript (I cannot remember where it is) so I took it and ran with
it to modify it to work with <a href="http://octopress.org">the blogging software</a> used here.</p>

<p>I went and asked some questions in the Freenode IRC channel for Octopress and found out
that they recommended the use of JS libraries that are compatible with <a href="http://dustindiaz.com/ender">Ender.js</a>.
Okay, so that was no problem. So what to use to make the actual AJAX request call to
the API? <a href="https://github.com/ded/reqwest">Reqwest</a> was mentioned by some as the best
fit for using with Ender. Reqwest is an easy-to-use JS AJAX library that the #octopress
guys suggest I use since jQuery doesn't currently play nice with all the other JS
libraries that Octopress is using.</p>

<p>Finally, I used <a href="https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore">Underscore</a> to 
help with templating.</p>

<p>Even though I'm not much of a JS whiz, I was able to take Ed's example and very quickly
modify it to work exactly the way I wanted it to. Below is the code I used to putt in 
my 10 latest Gimmes and insert them into the DOM exactly where I wanted them.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;My Latest Gimmies&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;ul id="gb_assets"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  reqwest({
      url: 'https://gimmebar.com/api/v0/public/assets/grumpycanuck.js?jsonp_callback=?',
      type: 'jsonp',
      success: function(data){
          var list_tpl = "&lt;% _.each(records, function(record) { %&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='https://gimmebar.com/view/&lt;%=record.id%&gt;'&gt;&lt;%=record.title%&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;% }); %&gt;";
          var list_html = _.template(list_tpl, data);
          $('#gb_assets').html(list_html);
      }
  });
  &lt;/script&gt;                                                                                                                                                     
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For those who aren't JS-savvy, I'll explain what goes on here:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Execute an AJAX call that...</li>
    <li>calls the Gimme Bar public API to get the latest 10 public posts...</li>
    <li>and on success generate an unordered list of posts...</li>
    <li>linking to the item on Gimme Bar and show the title...</li>
    <li>and insert it into the DOM where I asked it to</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy peasy, lemon squeezy. Ender.js + Reqwest + Underscore + 15 lines of markup and JS
gives me the latest 10 posts. Hope this inspires you to play with the Gimme Bar API
yourself.</p>

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2011/11/03/infrastructure-debt/">Infrastructure Debt</a></h2>
           <h3>November 3rd, 2011</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>You might have come across the term "technical debt", used to describe the small
mistakes that are made in your code base as the application grows and requirements
change. You end up with a big tangled mess if you are not very careful about
how you make those changes. If you've ever worked on an application where you
were afraid to make changes for fear of breaking something, then you have
run into technical debt.</p>

<p>It's very easy to build up technical debt: you put a quick hack in because you
feel like you are under pressure to get a task accomplished. It takes courage
to push back and say "no, damnit, I need time to fix this particular problem
correctly!". I understand, and it's okay. We can hug it out if it will make
you feel better.</p>

<p>Technical debt can be dealt with via ruthless refactoring and wrapping your
application in tests that poke and prod at the edge cases that your application
deals with. But there is another type of debt you end up dealing with. One that is
even more difficult to deal with and change. I call it infrastructure debt.</p>

<p>Infrastructure debt is debt that you build up because you have not been paying
attention to the process of creating the environments your application will exist
in and have not been paying attention to the process of how your code gets from
development into production. In my opinion, infrastructure debt is much more 
difficult to "pay off" than technical debt. Why? It is often very difficult
for people to understand that it even exists.</p>

<p>Before I go any further, if you are not using a version control system to keep
track of changes to your code, then please stop reading and go and install one.
Having versions of your files with extensions like .1 and .old is the worst
kind of infrastructure debt that you could possibly have. It's the 2nd decade
of the 21st century. Version control is an almost 40-years-old, well-understood concept.
Nothing I suggest will work if you insist on acting like version control
is of no use to you. Passing around diff patches is not version control, my
friends. It's denial. Don't tell me just because people used to do it in
the past that it's okay now given all the available options. People used to
think that the earth was flat once too.</p>

<p>Let's start with an easy infrastructure debt to pay off: inconsistency in development environments. These
days it is pretty easy for someone to create a development environment for their
language of choice along with associated components like databases. The problem?
That it's pretty easy for someone to create the development environment of their
choice.</p>

<p>You end up with your developers all having environments that are slightly different
due to choice of source for packages or preferences on versions of components. I have
PHP 5.3.8 via a custom Homebrew recipe while one of my co-workers has the stock
version of PHP that comes with OS-X Snow Leopard. He has a version of MySQL that is
two versions ahead of mine. See how easy it is to get out of sync?</p>

<p>You have two options. The first one is the draconian one, where you force everyone
to use the same operating system and the same tools to minimize the chances of 
conflicts between development environments. Given how that leads to developer
unhappiness, I prefer a more sane approach: use tools like <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> or <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> to
let your developers do their work on identical virtual machines while giving
them the freedom to use the development and debugging tools of their own choosing.</p>

<p>Also, by using a virtual machine you can encourage developers to push the envelope
and test destructive things like library upgrades or database changes. Messed it up?
Just fire up a new virtual machine and try again. When you combine it with good
version control practices you should be able to recover from your mistakes even
faster.</p>

<p>Just make sure to take the time to create virtual machines that are as close to
an exact match as your production systems as you can. Honestly, the only difference
between your development environment and your production environment should be the data
your application is manipulating. It's not really that hard to even create
a cluster of virtual machines on your own computer to simulate an architecture
that has application servers, a database server and a memcached server.</p>

<p>It also helps you to get new developers up to speed quickly. "Oh, working on 
Project Alpha? I'll email you the link on the wiki where you can download
the virtual machine for that project."</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> for a great option for developers
wishing to do their work in a virtual machine.</p>

<p>So, having injected some structure into your development environment there is
really one last frontier where infrastructure debt builds up like the
credit card bills of a shopaholic: deployment processes.</p>

<p>I really think there is one rule: if you cannot do your deployments with one
command then you are DOING IT WRONG. If you can type the commands you are 
doing into a shell then you can script them so you don't have to type
them in again. If you can script deployment, then you can automate
deployment. If you can automate deployment then you now have a consistent
and repeatable process that will behave the same way every single time
you deploy.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.moontoast.com">Moontoast</a> we have automated deployment in place.
When we merge code into our staging and production branches, a version control
hook triggers our deployment tool. It checks out our code into it's proper
location on the production server. It runs database migrations that need
to be done. It starts and restarts various services that are used by the
application. In short, it does everything that I see far too many of my
colleagues doing manually. Stop that. Clean up your infrastructure debt
by making the process of deploying your code a non-event.</p>

<p>If you want to automate your deployment process, examine tools like 
<a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki">Capistrano</a> or <a href="http://www.phing.info/trac/">Phing</a>
or you could even use a tool like <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> and use
it's concept of Builds to automate the process of taking your latest code
changes into production.</p>

<p>Note that I said the PROCESS, because technical debt might mean that your
application is fragile enough (doesn't have enough tests and/or test coverage)
that the changes you made might cause it to behave improperly or even crash
the system altogether. Not a good feeling, so by investing the time into
automating your deployment process you can eliminate at least one headache.</p>

<p>I think the main point I am trying to get across with respect to infrastructure
debt is that you really need to examine your processes beyond just coding. 
If you find yourself constantly fighting the "works on my computer" battle, 
you likely have serious infrastructure debt. If you find yourself constantly
referring to a checklist whenever you do a deployment, you likely have serious
infrastructure debt.</p>

<p>Whenever I bring this topic up, I hear many of the same excuses that I hear
when I advocate a commitment to writing tests and automating the execution
of those tests. What is it that people have against this sort of thing?</p>

<p>I have found that people terribly underestimate the amount of manual work they
do to accomplish a task. For many, it is a fear of losing control that leads
them to conclude that automated deployment cannot be trusted, or that 
developers shouldn't have the freedom to pick the tools that they use to 
build their applications.</p>

<p>Technical debt is real, make no mistake. But so is infrastructure debt. Just like
the cost of finding bugs in production is more than finding them in development,
the cost of fixing infrastructure debt gets more and more expensive. Just think
of the large number of problems solved by eliminating inconsistencies between
development environments. Add to that the ability to eliminate user error
during manual deployments of your application. Why would you not want to have 
this?</p>

<p>The decision to start paying down your infrastructure debt is not an easy one,
because it will often require many changes to be made by many people. Most
programmers are creatures of habit and dislike change, even when it is 
obviously better. Don't be scared of change, be scared of the debt growing
in your code base and in your infrastructure. It won't go away and
there is no government bailout on the way to fix it.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome your thoughts via email, Twitter and comments on this blog. 
What sort of infrastructure problems have you come across and how did you fix them?</p>

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2011/10/24/grumpy-programmers-guide-to-remote-working-part-2/">The Grumpy Programmer&#039;s Guide To Remote Working, Part 2</a></h2>
           <h3>October 24th, 2011</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As mentioned in the previous post about remote working, you do have to work a lot harder when you're not in the same office as your co-workers in order to simply get things done. If you took my advice you've got yourself a sweet setup at home, with a comfy chair and a nice desk. But that is only the first battle in the on-going war that is successful telecommuting. In this post I want to talk about some tools that I use that I feel help me Get Shit Done when working from home.</p>

<p>First, since you don't have the instant feedback loop of a fellow cubicle dweller or even office-sharing partner, you need tools that can act as a second set of eyes for you before you open what is often an expensive communication channel to your co-workers. Not expensive in terms of money (unless you have to call people long distance and don't either use VOIP at home or Skype) but expensive in terms of time. Making that initial "communication handshake" is expensive in time and commitment.</p>

<p>So for me, the first set of eyes I use are <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> or Chrome's web developer tools, depending on which browser I'm using. Those let me peek at the HTML being generated and debug any Ajax calls your application is making. It used to be my primary tool until <a href="http://twitter.com/ramsey">my boss</a> asked me why I wasn't using <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a>, an awesome debugging proxy application for OS-X, Windows and Linux.</p>

<p>Charles acts like what it says: it's a web debugging proxy. It sits between your browser and your next work connection, monitoring and showing you what connections you are making. Why is this awesome you might ask? I can record an entire series of clicks on a web page and play them back later for testing purposes.
I like Charles for a few reasons. This is helpful because one of our main applications at Moontoast is a flash-based store and Charles will show me the request that the flash SWF is making <em>and</em> I can see the response that is coming back. I am not a flash developer, but I do need to make sure that code I write that is supposed to talk back to the SWF (via AMF) is returning correct values. I like to record Ajax calls and repeat them over and over until I am happy with the response coming back. Please, please, PLEASE check out Charles. It is worth every penny.</p>

<p>So now that I have someone else helping me debug my Ajax and AMF calls, what other tools do I find useful. Well, if you don't have your editor already tricked out to reduce the amount of work you have to do <em>outside</em> of your editor to get things done then I advise you to actually learn your editor inside and out. As a vim user I spend a lot of time evaluating plugins that can help me out. I use <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">Syntastic</a> to run my code through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_programming_tool">code linter</a> every time I save it. I use <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Fugitive</a> to work on my Git commits and merges. All in all, it's important that you be as productive as possible using the tool you write your code with day in and day out.</p>

<p>Of course, it goes without saying that you should be probably be writing your own tests for your code that you can automate. Don't worry, this is not going to turn into another sales job for automated testing. PHPUnit, PHPSpec, Selenium, please use something that acts as an automated tester for you. I mean, it seems to work for me so maybe it can work for you.</p>

<p>So that's really it in terms of tools that I have found that I used more and more as I telecommuted more and more. My criteria for evaluating any tools is this: is it easy to use, can it automate something I don't want to do manually, and does it easily integrate into my existing workflow. Firebug and Charles fit that criteria. Plugins for my editor fit that criteria. CLI test runners fit that criteria.</p>

<p>In other words, any tool that can make you more productive in an office setting is even more important when working remotely with a team. Anything that you can do to reduce the testing and integration step benefits you and your team, and helps to convince management that their decision to allow you to continue to work remotely is a good one.</p>

<p>I'm interested in hearing other people's experiences telecommuting and tools that they have found to be helpful. Comment in this post, send me some email (chartjes AT this domain) or hit me up on Twitter.</p>
