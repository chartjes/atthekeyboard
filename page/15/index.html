            <p>Today is my 42nd birthday, which is 420 in internet years. I am feeling old
but thankful that I have so many friends who keep lying to me and saying I'm
not a programming dinosaur.</p>

<p>I haven't done one of these blog posts in a while, so I thought I would solicit
some ideas from my Twitter followers and address a few of them.</p>

<h1 id="can-i-unit-test-in-140-characters-or-less%3F">Can I unit test in 140 characters or less?</h1>

<p>No. Testing, in general, does not lead itself to brevity. The tools we use
to test our code in an automated fashion can only abstract so much away from
us before we actually have to write some code.</p>

<p>Large amounts of setup work is a sign that perhaps your code-under-test is
doing too much. Sometimes it is unavoidable if you are using dependency
injection to create multiple dependencies.</p>

<p>Of course, "large" is also subjective. I would offer my opinion on what "large
amounts of setup work" means to me, but that would just lead to people arguing
with me about testing when I'd rather argue about why dick jokes spoken at
conferences are the tip of the metaphorical iceberg that represents white male
privilege in the tech industry.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em></p>

<h1 id="what-are-your-favourite-vim-plugins%3F">What are your favourite Vim plugins?</h1>

<p>I group the plugins I use into two categories: "essential" and "everything else".
Right now, I only have four essential plugins:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> for organizing my plugins</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ervandew/supertab">Supertab</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">Syntastic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">Surround.vim</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All other plugins swap in and out depending on my mood and whatever problems
I am attempting to solve in code. Right now I've got the following</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=13">Closetag</a></li>

<h1 id="is-grumpy-cat-your-cat%3F">Is Grumpy Cat your Cat?</h1>

<p>No.</p>

<h1 id="life-as-a-unicorn-in-canada">Life as a unicorn in Canada</h1>

<p>This was asked tongue-in-cheek by my <a href="https://twitter.com/PolarLava">boss</a>, who 
refers to me as his "Canadian unicorn" because of my unique status within 
the company  but
I think it's actually better re-framed as "what is it like working in a senior
role when you are remote?"</p>

<p>First, my co-workers go to great lengths to make sure that myself and the
two other remote workers in a group of over a dozen (I cannot remember all
the people who are on the other team that makes up our group) are integrated
into all decisions.</p>

<p>We have been experimenting with using Google+ Hangouts as a way for all the
remote workers to see what's going on in the office. Despite my initial
reservations that it's simply a way for nervous management to keep an eye on
us I think it has worked out well. They've created a permanent "remote station"
and people have walked up to it to find one of us and ask us directly a
question.</p>

<p>It's growing on me, and I have also started looking at this awesome site on
<a href="http://remotepairprogramming.com/">making remote pair programming smoother</a> 
for inspiration on how to make it better. I already use my iPad as my "personal device"
while working from home, so it seems natural to start using it as my visual gateway
into the office.</p>

<p>Second, because I am remote and therefore trusted to work for long stretches
of time with Eyeball Supervision (a.k.a walking up behind you and asking what
you're working on) you get assigned tasks that can be done by one person
(sometimes two if the other can be dedicated to the task) and take a while
to do.</p>

<p>Unless you make the commitment to do remote pair-programming (which I have
done with great success) you should get used to working on stuff in a directly-unsupervised
fashion.</p>

<p>This suits me just fine.</p>

<p>Finally, make sure that everyone who has to work with you knows that just because
you are remote does not mean that you are unwilling to do one-on-one communication
with people. I have a soft phone that work has provided me, and I get phone calls
from co-workers asking me stuff. I do Skype calls and lots of text chats.</p>

<p>In other words, I probably talk to my co-workers about work-related stuff
as much as anyone else in the office.</p>

<p>What I miss out on are the social events that happen. That sucks, but I always
make sure to do something at my end (and expense it ;) ) very similar to 
what my co-workers are doing. If they get pizza during a tech presentation, I
make sure to order myself something similar.</p>

<p>Remember, being remote does not mean that you are invisible.</p>

<h1 id="productivity-and-task-management-tips">Productivity and task management tips</h1>

<p>How does this grumpy guy get things done while working remotely?</p>

<ul>
<li>pay attention in meetings so that you are not forced into positions that
are untenable for you</li>
<li>work hard to get everything done that you have promised to do</li>
<li>work hard to communicate with everyone because you can't just walk over to
their cubicle / office to bitch at them for not getting stuff done on your own
schedule</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it really. Get stuff done, do good work, and there will be fewer and
fewer excuses for your employer to prevent others from reaping the rewards
of your trail-blazing efforts.</p>

<h1 id="a-day-in-the-life-of-a-grumpy-programmer">A Day in the life of a Grumpy Programmer</h1>

<ul>
<li>woken up at 6am by the Office Manager, who is seeking cat treats for himself
and the HR Manager</li>
<li>lay in bed in a daze until 6:45am when my wife is showered, dressed and heads
downstairs.</li>
<li>wake kids up at 7am and putter around getting breakfast and lunches together</li>
<li>throw kids out of the house between 8am and 8:15am so they are not late for
school</li>
<li>have breakfast, work out, shower and start my day</li>
</ul>

<p>For the rest, just follow me on Twitter to get a feel for my mood. ;)</p>

            <p>After I wrote my <a href="http://grumpy-testing.com">first Leanpub book</a> I would get
asked all the time on how to use PHPUnit itself. Again, much like the information
I put into the "Grumpy Testing" book, I found lots of shallow information on
how to use PHPUnit itself.</p>

<p>I did some research <a href="http://unicornfree.com/30x500">30x500 style</a>, worked
on my pitch while writing the book, and on March 4th I launched <a href="http://grumpy-phpunit.com">"The Grumpy Programmer's PHPUnit Cookbook"</a>.</p>

<p>This book is a collection of the most common tips and techniques I use myself
to write effective and quick tests for PHP code. If you've ever wondered
how to create mock objects, or wanted to know how to test code that uses
remote API calls, my book will help you.</p>

<p>As my way of saying thank you to those who read my blog, you can use the code
GRUMPYFEED to get $5 off my book for the next week.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome your feedback via email (chartjes@littlehart.net) or
Twitter (@grmpyprogrammer).</p>

            <p>To paraphrase Batman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Programmers are a cowardly, superstitious lot"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Programmers often look to external sources for validation of
all sorts of things they do. Did they choose the right
language? Are they writing good code? Will they be
accepted by their peers.</p>

<p>Of course, there are those who are leaders within a 
community. Those who manage to do great things
but with an idiosyncratic way of doing things.
Let's call these people shamans. In many ways
programming is a mystical thing: you conjure
up solutions to problems using tools that
often require strange incantations.</p>

<p>For those who pay attention to the workings of the PHP community
you might have heard about the "PHP Standards Recommendations"
that have been coming out of the <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/">PHP Framwork Interop Group</a>.</p>

<p>It's first contribution was <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">PSR-0</a>, which covers recommended standards for
autoloading of PHP code (no more remembering to require/include files
any more to load your class files), then followed by <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md">PSR-1</a> (which covers basic coding standards) and <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md">PSR-2</a> which is about a coding style guideline.</p>

<p>More recently this group has been working on a standard for logging 
interfaces called <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-3-logger-interface.md">PSR-3</a>.</p>

<p>I spoke about this on Twitter, and I will repeat it here: 
I think PHP programmers should get behind PSR-0 and efforts like
PSR-3. I feel that PSR-1 and PSR-2 are solutions looking for
a problem and seem, to me anyway, to me out of place with
the solutions offered by PSR-0 and PSR-3.</p>

<p>Standards that are enforced by the community have a power
that people really don't understand. The classic example of
this are the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/">Python Enhancement Proposals</a>.
They cover a incredible range of ideas and concepts that a Python
developer needs to worry about.</p>

<p>PEP-8, which covers coding standards, is probably the one most
casual Python programmers are familiar with. The whole community followed
it, which might have been easier due to Python's use of significant
whitespace. But more importantly, it was championed by
Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, Guido van Rossum.
He was able to use his soapbox as the guiding force behind it.</p>

<p>PSR-1 and PSR-2 are generating a lot of, well, pissing and moaning 
from people. I get it: I often grind my teeth when looking at
code written in a style that deviates quite a bit from my
normal coding style and practices.</p>

<p>However, it's far more important to be able to understand
what the code is doing. PSR-0, in my opinion, serves to standardize
application layout for the purpose of making it easier to
load classes you need in your code. PSR-3 (and similar interface
standard recommendations) serves to allow you to integrate
3rd party code with yours a lot quicker.</p>

<p>Standards, soapboxes and shamans are an integral part of
any programming community that wants to move forward and keep
producing better and better tools and applications. Any programming
language community that does not work as hard as possible to
make it easier to integrate other's libraries of code together
is asking for irrelevancy.</p>
