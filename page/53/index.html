<p>
<i>Node.js is something I want to use, but I do not know what for</i><br />
For those who don't know, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> is a "toolkit for writing extremely high performance non-blocking event driven network servers in JavaScript".  In other words, it's for writing server-side Javascript with an emphasis on providing concurrency.  Damn you Tim Bray, I cannot avoid seeing concurrency everywhere since you started your <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/09/27/Concur-dot-next">Concur.next</a> series on your blog.  It fascinates me, and I don't even do any kind of work where I need to worry about concurrency.  Not yet anyway.
</p>

<p>
Simon Wilson (someone I follow from the Django community) has a great article explaining why <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Nov/23/node/">Node.js is genuinely exciting</a> to him, and my old CakePHP landsmann Felix shows <a href="http://debuggable.com/posts/streaming-file-uploads-with-node-js:4ac094b2-b6c8-4a7f-bd07-28accbdd56cb">how to handling streaming file uploads in node.js</a>.  Like so many new technologies, Node.js starts out as a solution looking for a problem but as I become more familiar with concurrency it all becomes a little clearer.
</p>

<p>
<i>While <a href='http://www.vim/org">Vim</a> is awesome, don't put up with any crap from it</i><br />
I had been experiencing a problem with Vim.  Well, two problems.  The first big one was weird behaviour involving the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1849">AutoClose</a> plugin.  It would spit out brackets and quotes at the weirdest time, and I found myself doing a lot of unnecessary keystrokes (and toggling in and out of insert mode) to get things done.  So I deleted it.  Enough of that crap.  Same goes with my attempts to use the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69">Project plugin</a>.  I just could not get it to work properly.  DELETED.
</p>

<p>
Vim's ability to be ultracustomizable ALSO makes it easy to dump stuff when you no longer what to use it.  Heck, I even see some stuff in my .vimrc that I am not using any more.  Mappings I did to accomplish some specific tasks.  Those were deleted too.
</p>

<p>
<i>Understanding the concept of callbacks opens your mind to all sorts of possibilities</i><br />
While callbacks are related to my use of Javascript (jQuery uses them to great success) I also find myself digging into the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/signals/">documentation in Django on signals</a>, which are callbacks by another name:  functionality that is executed when certain events happen.</p>

<p>Django uses them all over the place, and CakePHP uses them as well.  When I look at the CodeIgniter code that powers <a href="http://www.sportso.com">Sportso</a>, I often ruminate about what programming techniques or design patterns could help me reduce the amount of code that has actually been written.  CodeIgniter doesn't really support callbacks except in the form of allowing you to define custom functions for validation purposes.  It's a start I get.  I wonder what the code would look like if I could define more code that is triggered when specific events happen?  Any time I find myself typing the same block of code over and over again, it is only natural that I seek to reduce how often I need to do it.

            <p>Once I got a production push out of the way at work, I set about recreating my PHP development environment.  Currently I was running PHP 5.3.0 with Apache2 and Postgresql 8.4, all installed via MacPorts.  Why the time for a change?  Two reasons.  The first one is my desire to constantly tinker and tweak my environment.  The second reason was to test out some things for future work projects.
</p>

<p>
Those who follow the blog know that I had successfully convinced The Powers That Be at work to use Zend Framework to build out future PHP projects.  I also decided that it would be good to examine if <a href='http://www.zend.com/en/products/server-ce/index'>Zend Server Community Issue</a> is a viable stack for us.  In order to make that decision, I needed to install it and check it out.</p>

<p>
Being the cutting-edge guy that I am, I installed the beta version that comes with PHP 5.3.  I remember that I was having problems getting ZSCE working on Snow Leopard, but those problems seem to have disappeared.  Flawless install, and with about 10 minutes of work tweaking Apache configuration files I had my new PHP stack back.
</p>

<p>
I have to admit that to a jaded "I am sick of personally compiling my stack" person that I am acting like these days, the control panel for Zend Server is nice.  Point and click to add whatever extensions I need.  No more recompiling!  Perfect.  After playing with this, next week I will be installing it on our dev server at work.  MySQL is totally busticated for some reason, so wiping things clean and starting over with the Zend-provided version will be a welcome thing.  It will allow me to actually test some things front-to-back on the dev server.  Apathy towards your program's environment is a killer, so this will help me tighten things up.
</p>

<p>
So, with that out of the way the next step was figuring out what to do about Postgres.  Luckily this part was *really* easy.  I did a pg_dump of the entire database server and went and installed the version of Postgresql for OS-X that <a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/download.do">EnterpriseDB</a> has.  Again, a flawless install and I was up and running in no time.  Created my desired users, and imported my database.  Again, it took about 10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
Other than the required tweak to my php.ini to declare the timezone for the server (I got this humungous warning in CodeIgniter about it) it was smooth sailing.  So now I had Apache 2, PHP 5.3, MySQL and Postgresql, all detached from MacPorts.  Next step was to remove MacPorts itself and I was good to go.
</p>

<p>
MacPorts, it was fun, but I've learned to get by without you.

            <p>While working away I was listening (okay, and peeking once in a while) at the live stream from the announcement from Google about <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">Chrome OS</a>, an operating system they've been working on.  From what I can tell, it's going to be some stripped-down version of Linux with a window manager that runs one thing:  the Chrome browser.
</p>

<p>
Now, while I think a netbook is great for someone like my <a href="http://teachersatrisk.com">mom</a>, or my daughter, I cannot imagine myself doing any sort of serious programming work on one.  Or can I?</p>

<p>So, first of all it looks like <a href="http://www.vim.org"> is a non-starter.  That means I would likely have to use something like </a><a href="https://mozillalabs.com/bespin/">Mozilla Bespin</a> as my editor.  A quick Google search showed me that you can edit remote files using Bespin, so that is a good thing.  But I would miss doing all the system-level things I've grown accustomed too.  Would make it pretty much impossible to do command line testing of code.
</p>

<p>
And what about all my tools for managing databases?  All the web-based database manipulation tools (like <a href="http://phpmyadmin.net">phpMyAdmin</a> or <a href="http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/">phpPgAdmin</a> can probably meet that need.  But then I'm looking at some sort of web-based SSH client to be able to look at things like server configurations or slow query logs.  Again, it's probably doable but is it optimal?
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it's an interesting thought.  Perhaps I should spend some time trying to see if I could actually be productive using the tools I just mentioned above.
