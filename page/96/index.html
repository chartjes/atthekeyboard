Not a lot going on, it's time for a quick round-up post
<ul>
<li>I'm speaking at <a href='http://www.cakefest.org'>CakeFest</a>, so I'm working on my presentation.  Since I'm going to be a combination of slides and actual demonstrations of the Cake console, I'm going to be using <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a> to run the slideshow, then switching to a terminal and my IDE to show people the results</li>
<li>I've run into a weird bug in working with Cake and Postgres, where the code works okay in PHP 5 + Postgres + OS-X, but erroring out in PHP 4 + Postgres + Linux.  If I could figure out a test to recreate the bug, that would be a good step forward.  In a nutshell, for some reason CakePHP is not determining the correct name of the sequence (it's what Postgres uses when determining auto-incremented ID's for a table) in the PHP 4 + Postgres + Linux environment.  It's very weird and I have no idea what might be happening here.  Given that I can't submit a ticket without a test proving the problem, and then figuring out what code to change, this could cause me some headaches.</li>
<li>I suck at writing screen scrapers, which is what I need to make one of my side projects work</li>
<li>Via the ever-increasingly-useful Miro, I have started watching a presentation on <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/">the Lively Kernel</a>.  For some more info about it,  check out this post about how <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/290/JavaScript-is-the-new-Smalltalk">Javascript is the new Smalltalk</a></li>
<li>I've been playing around with different themes for this blog, but nothing seems to work as well as my current setup.  Interesting...</li>
<li>I also experimented with adding some more advertising but that got me nothing in the way of revenue.  Maybe I didn't give it enough time or something. My current set of advertisers (thank you very much, guys and gals) make this blog pay for itself, so I consider that a major accomplishment.

           <h3>January 22nd, 2008</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I got a question in the comments about my previous post on simple user registration about how to do some of the necessary validation for registration in the model.  I thought I'd show some code I did to do exactly that.
</p>

<p>
The key to all this stuff is using a second form field for doing the validation.  Here's some sample code for you, based on the latest straight-from-svn version of Cake PHP 1.2 (r6402)
<br /><br />
~~~
<?php

/**
 * Class used for user authentication on the league website
 *
 */

class User extends AppModel
{
    var $name = 'User';

    var $validate = array(
        'id' => array('rule' => 'blank',
                      'on' => 'create'),
        'username' => array('rule' => 'alphanumeric',
                            'required' => true,
                            'message' => 'Please enter a username'),
        'password' => array('rule' => array('confirmPassword', 'password'),
                            'message' => 'Passwords do not match'),
        'password_confirm' => array('rule' => 'alphanumeric',
                                    'required' => true)
    );

    function confirmPassword($data) {
        $valid = false;
        
        if ($data['password'] == Security::hash(Configure::read('Security.salt') . $this->data['User']['password_confirm'])) {
            $valid = true;
        } 
        
        return $valid;
    }

}
?>
~~~
</p>

<p>
So, let's talk about what's in there.  
<ul>
<li>make sure that the username is alphanumeric and has been entered</li>
<li>make sure the password exists and run the custom validation function 'confirmPassword' on the data being posted in</li>
<li>make sure that our confirm password field exists and is alphanumeric</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The only tricky thing when I made this was figuring out how to compare the two password fields, and where to get the proper hashing from.  Initially I thought that I could somehow import the Auth component in there but a quick chat with gwoo showed me how stupid that was when I could just duplicate how the component itself is hashing the password field.  That's what is going in with the use of Security::hash(...).
</p>

<p>
Hope that helps.

Yes, it's been confirmed:  I will be attending <a href='http://www.cakefest.org'>CakeFest</a> down in Orlando Feb. 6 to 8.  I'll be giving a talk entitled "Fake It Until You Make It" about how to use the Cake console tools to speed up your development.  I use the Cake console for all my CakePHP projects, since it helps me quickly create the code for models, controllers (love being able to have all those admin methods already baked in) and I hope to show those who might be a little shy of using the command line what they are missing out on.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to be flying down Tuesday night, getting in around midnight and flying out Friday morning (it's looking like a 10:30 departure).  So that's two full days at the conference, which is okay.  Now, if anyone is going down there and could use a roomie to help cut down on costs let me know.
