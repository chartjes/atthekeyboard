            <h2><a href="/2009/08/01/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-2-accountability/">So You Want To Telecommute? Part 2 - Accountability</a></h2>
           <h3>August 1st, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>In <a href="http//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2009/07/29/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-1-building-trust">part one</a> of this series, I talked about the integral role that trust plays in telecommuting.  Next up we need to talk about the tools you're going to need in order to show accountability while telecommuting.</p>

<p>
When I accepted my telecommuting position, the first thing that happened was that I immediately felt less-stressed because I no longer had my 90 minutes in / 120 minutes out commute to deal with.  For many, that is the number one reason they want to work from home.  Then, I realized that I would also be in an environment where I would be able to control the distractions.  In previous jobs, it was that inability to shut out the distractions when I needed to was the problem. 
</p>

<p>In your typical developer cube-farm, there is zero chance that you can find some quiet and solitude when you need it.  All I ever wanted was an office where I could close the damn door when I needed to Get Things Done.  C'mon, you think putting on your headphones is enough to drown out the world around you.  Perhaps it's because I am a grumpy old man, but that just won't cut it.
</p>

<p>
However, you cannot work in isolation when telecommuting for a company, as opposed to freelancing.  There are fellow employees that you will need to speak with, probably on a regular basis.  Telecommuting is not for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy">misanthropes</a> who dream of long stretches of uninterrupted work.  You *will* be asked to prove that you're working, not sitting on the couch playing video games when you're supposed to be debugging that new Ajax-powered user interface.  Just pushing your code into production isn't enough.
</p>

<p>We have our own home-brewed ticketing system that started out as a way for clients to inform us of issues they are having, or requests for changes to the services we deliver to them.  Since I have been here (some of it at my prompting), it has also branched out into bug and feature tracking for our various internal projects.</p>

<p>
Also, another reason for it is accountability.  While our clients (obviously) cannot see the tickets for internal projects, we can see each other's tickets.  Clients are also able to see every entry in the tickets system related to their issues.  During our weekly staff meeting (more on the format for that in the next installment) we discuss "dangling tickets", which are issues that have not been resolved in a timeframe that we are comfortable.  Without a transparent issue-tracking system, it would be too easy to try and deny accountability when stuff isn't getting done.
</p>

<p>
Just using email for this sort of thing is, in my opinion, a mistake.  It's too easy to say "I didn't get that email" or "I must've missed that email".  If you're not tracking your outstanding issues in a way that others can't see, you're asking for trouble as a telecommuter.  Sure, not everything we do goes into that issue tracking system.  But anything that's critical to your ability to get your assigned tasks done, you have to let other people know what you're doing.  Otherwise you have no justification for asking for help, or even re-prioritizing your tasks.
</p>

<p>
So, with your issue-tracking system in place you can now start delving deeper into fine-tuning your work flow.  If your issue-tracking system can keep track of the dates when issues were generated and then resolved, you can get an idea of your velocity on tasks.  Then the next time you need to do something very similar, you can tell your boss with confidence how long it will take you next time.  Now you can get back to playing vid...I mean, get back to planning your next task.
</p>

<p>Also, knowing how long things will take to do, with a good level of accuracy, lets you give your boss surprising bits of information like "Hrm, ticket 3478 is like an older ticket I did a few months back.  I should be able to get that finished 2 days ahead of the current schedule, so I've got time to tweak that automated deployment task that's flagged as low personal priority.  Okay if I get that working today and Friday?"
</p>

<p>
Yes, things like this can and do happen.  In fact, I try to make sure that I keep an eye on lower-priority tasks that can be pushed up in priority if I happen to get something done ahead of schedule.  Not every task in my list is labeled "high priority", which is something I blame  my boss for :)
</p>

<p>
Next up, I will share my experiences with staying in touch with your fellow workers while maintaining sanity in your work flow.</p>

           <h3>July 29th, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I had been planning for a while to write a series of articles about my experiences with telecommuting.  Prompted by <a href="http://blog.calevans.com/2009/07/29/remote-developers/">Cal Evans blog post about remote developers</a> I decided it was time.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>My current position as a "software engineer" for <a href="http://www.xmlteam.com">XML Team Solutions</a> is a 100% telecommuting job.  In fact, all of us telecommute:  
<ul>
<li>I'm in Milton (about 40 minutes or so west of Toronto)</li>
<li>two in Toronto</li>
<li>one in <a href="http://www.saublebeach.com">Sauble Beach, Ontario, Canada</a> (a small town on the eastern shores of Lake Huron)</li>
<li>one in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada</li>
<li>one in Beverly Hills, California, USA</li>
<li>one Connecticut, USA</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Now, when you have a company where none of your fellow employees works in the same city, let alone the same country, you quickly find out what the key issue really is: trust.  If you don't trust that the people who work with are professional enough to GET SHIT DONE then telecommuting will not work.  It really is that simple.  I've met my boss in person a grand total of 3 times.  Sure, there have been some video chats and phone calls but we've only actually been together on three occasions:  our corporate retreat just after I got hired, once to attend a trade show in Florida, and once just recently to attend a trade show in Pittsburgh.  Unlike a lot of people, I do not dread meeting my boss. ;)
</p>

<p>
Look, I know that some people who manage developers are convinced that if they were to allow telecommuting on a regular basis that people would instead spend time screwing around instead of getting work done.  This attitude is unfortunately very common.  Even more disappointing are the people who *do* screw around when telecommuting instead of actually working.  I guess they don't realize how it's hurting their chances of doing it going forward.
</p>

<p>The "command-and-control" management style that seems to be applied at some software companies creates an adversarial relationship between employees and employer.  By forcing you to come into an office to work every day, it is a not-so-subtle message that you are not trusted to get things done without supervision.  I've been through this in my own professional career, and sometimes this attitude is warranted.  If you've had the misfortune of having (or working with) a group of employees more interested in goofing off than doing the job that the business requires, then you know what I'm talking about here.  However, I'm more interested in the idea of the value of trust in telecommuting and hiring employees that you can trust to get work done.
</p>

<p>
Now before you start dismissing what I'm saying here, I understand that there is usually a really good reason to have all your developers in one place other than you want to keep an eye on them:  meetings.  But then again, don't people have conference calls all the time?  Or is there something about collaborative developer work that people think does not work with telecommuters?  In my next installment I will talk about what I think are the critical tools for managing collaboration amongst telecommuting developers.

            <h2><a href="/2009/07/22/some-clarity-about-canadian-health-care/">Some Clarity About Canadian Health Care</a></h2>
           <h3>July 22nd, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Now normally I stay far away from discussing politics on my blog, or anything not related to programming.  However, the debate going on in the US right now over plans to implement some sort of government-funded health care plan in one I find fascinating.  I have many American friends that I follow via Twitter and some of the things I have read have made me decide that a blog post from someone familiar with the Canadian health care system might help clear things up.</p>

<p>I must also provide this disclaimer:  I am not a doctor, no-one in my immediate family is a doctor, but I do know people who work as doctors and nurses have spoken with them about these issues in the past.</p>

<p>
Let's start by looking at my understanding of the US health care system as it stands right now.  The US spends more per person than any other country to provide health care, yet it appears that the vast majority of people are unable to benefit from this.  I have read / heard anecdotal evidence that suggests that huge medical bills are the cause for the financial ruin of many families, and a leading cause of bankruptcies.  This is a tragedy that no-one should have to go through.</p>

<p>
On the flip side, the US is the source of many medical breakthroughs.  But I would hazard a guess that the quality of health care a system delivers is in no way related to the ability of that system to develop new procedures or new drugs.  I see them as two different systems, that interact with each other at the end of discovery.  I hope that makes sense.
</p>

<p>
So, let's take a look at how the health care system works in my home province of Ontario.  I was born in Ontario and have lived my entire life here.  My only exposure to what some people would call "critical" surgery was when I was two years old.  I had eye surgery on my left eye to correct a lazy eye that would've left me cross-eyed (and a circus-show freak as my wife often reminds me).  That's been it.  However, various family members of mine have been in the position of needing surgery of the "non-optional" variety, so I think I'm somewhat qualified to discuss this.
</p>

<p>
Now, those who oppose the government getting involved in being the ones who fund the health care system seem to have a few objections.  This is by no means a comprehensive list, but some of these objections are:
<ul>
<li>it will cost more than what is being spent on it by now</li>
<li>people have to wait for vital surgery</li>
<li>people will not have any choice as to what doctor they get to see</li>
<li>it will stop innovation in the field of drug research</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I think those 4 are enough for me to start with.  Let's look at them one at a time.</p>

<h3>It will cost more than what is being spent on it now</h3>

<p>
Yeah, I don't see how this is possible.  If you replace insurance companies with the government, despite the government's well-earned reputation for mismanagement it will cost less because the government won't be looking to turn a profit.  Canada's costs-per-capita are significantly lower than the US.  So I think it's safe to say this objection is not true.
</p>

<h3>People will have to wait for vital surgery</h3>

<p>
This is something that both Americans and Canadians like to throw around, especially those who would like to think that by spending some of their own money they can get the health care they need RIGHT NOW.   See, this issue is a case of perception vs. reality.  I will use my father as an example.  My father has had surgery on both eyes, one knee and his shoulder in the last two years.  From the time he went to see the doctor to say "I need this fixed" until the surgery in question happened, I would estimate no more than three months elapsed in every case.
</p>

<p>
Now, if he had needed to get this stuff done right away he could've gotten it in less than a week.  If you have a life-threatening problem, they get you what you need incredibly fast.  The problem is that one person's life-threatening problem sometimes appears to be a minor inconvenience in the eyes of the health care system.  A bum knee that you can still walk on is not going to get you to jump to the front of the line.  As I have told many of my American friends, if you have a life-threatening problem you will get the care you need right away.  If you are not in immediate danger or disabled, well, you're just going to have to wait.  Since I have not run into this in the US, I don't know what to say to people about this.  Sorry that paying for it yourself won't let you jump to the front of the line?  That's somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but wait times for minor procedures are common in the US too, aren't they?  
</p>

<p>Also, I wish to tell people that the Canadian health-care system DOES NOT PAY FOR EVERYTHING.  It pays for basic medical care and life-saving surgeries for it's citizens.  I still have to pay for dental care, optical care and prescription drugs out of my own pocket.  Many Canadian employers offer supplemental insurance to their employees to cover this.  My wife's company does, my own does not.  But if I break my leg playing softball, I know I won't be given a bill as I limp out of hospital.  I will have to pay for the painkillers, that's for sure.
</p>

<p>So, in our system I'm willing to accept that waiting for non-critical surgery is ok.  I think I have presented evidence that makes this objection not valid.</p>

<h3>People will not have any choice as to what doctor they get to see</h3>

<p>
This is totally false.  The government does not tell me who I can and cannot see to receive health care from.  I am allowed to pick and choose my own family doctor, and I am limited to the choice of any specialist for a particular procedure based only on the availability of that doctor within Ontario to see me.  Yes, there are times when the government pays for out-of-province procedures (yes, including going to Buffalo for an MRI if needed) so that option sometimes exists.  But that is in extreme circumstances only.  So please, don't believe it when an opponent of government-funded health care talks about people only dying waiting for procedures in a government-funded system.  It happens in the US too.</p>

<p>I think it's also a good time to give a little insight into how the government actually pays doctors.  See, the doctor tell the government what services they have provided for their patients.  The government then says "okay, we will give you X amount of money for what you've done according to the following rules" and that is that.  Doctors cannot charge above government rates for procedures that the government pays doctors for.  That does not mean that doctors are unable to charge what they want for procedures the government health care system does not pay for.  My mother had minor cosmetic surgery to remove some moles and skin tags near her eyes and I spit my drink out when she told me how much it cost her.  I'm guessing that is the normal reaction in the US.
</p>

<h3>It Will Stop Innovation In The Field Of Drug Research</h3>

<p>I'm not qualified to speak to this, but I will say the following: it will certainly reduce the *profits* pharmaceutical companies make.  An American friend of mine tried to explain to me why this was such a bad thing, and that if a company decided to not sell a life-saving drug to the government-run system that it would be a bad thing for patients.  I agreed with him, and also agreed that the government shouldn't force pharma to sell them the drugs.  Will this cause problems?  Probably.  Maybe it just opens up a way for a competitor to sell a similar drug to the government instead.  But if the pharma industry can't make huge amounts of money, I'm guessing they are reluctant to invest it in R&D, although I think the massive amount of money they would not have to spend on marketing might offset that.  So I am okay with saying that this statement *might* be true, unless the government agrees to buy the pills for something resembling a fair return on pharma investment.
</p>

<p>
So there you have a small and hopefully-informative look at the Canadian health care system.  Is it perfect?  No.  But it delivers a level of service that should be causing Americans to want to emulate it, not demonize it.  Basic health care is a right that should be given to all citizens as it benefits society as a whole.  You can call me a socialist if you want, but I've seen the benefits of our health care system up close and personal.  
</p>

<p>
If you have something to add in the comments, please be aware that I will delete any comments that I find objectionable.  Keep it clean and reasonable.
