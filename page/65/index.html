           <h3>May 21st, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Joel Moss (a fellow member of the CakePHP community) has been acting like a bit of a Rails (and Ruby) fanboi as of late.  He's doing a series of blog posts proclaiming his <a href="http://developingwithstyle.com/2009/05/20/10-reasons-why-ruby-is-better-than-php-reason-1/">love for Ruby</a>.  Personally, I loved Rails when I first encountered it.  Played around with it.  Wrote a web site for my simulation baseball league in it.  Then started disliking *some* of the people in the community and are now pretty much ambivalent about Ruby and Rails in general.  Great tool, not for me.  Python seems to be a better fit for me at least.</p>

<p>
I think a lot of what he says is nonsense and can be summarized with "I don't like PHP's syntax."  Hell, I don't even like it myself.  PHP's big problem has been consistency with parameter order and a less-than-stellar object implementation.  Yes, things have improved in terms of OOP (closures and traits!) but PHP clings hard to it's procedural roots and that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Slamming PHP for it's OO implementation is like picking at a scab so it never goes away.  Pointless.  "PHP sucks because of bad syntax" is an argument I'd expect from my 9 year-old daughter, not a good programmer like Joel.  Kind of disappointing.  Never mind all the awesome built-in functions or wealth of high-quality third-party libraries out there for PHP.  Sure, those things exist for Ruby too but often you only have one or two choices.  PHP is absolutely rich in choices of third-party libraries.  Sure, a lot of them are not top quality but it never takes long to figure that out.  Okay, I'm drifting.  On to the rest of my point.
</p>

<p>
 I think where Joel starts to go off the rails was a follow-up in Twitter that said "Hands up if you're a lazy developer. [I proudly hold both my hands up high in the sky] Laziness makes me a better coder http://bit.ly/MKFQe".   Once and for all, we need to stamp out the "laziness makes me a better coder" meme that is picking up steam.  There is a HUGE difference between laziness defined as "I want to write less code" and laziness defined as "I don't want to have to figure shit out.".  The first one is called efficiency, not laziness.  The second one is the type of trait that a programmer should be ashamed to have.
</p>

<p>
I realize now that reliance on the use of frameworks for your applications is the type of laziness that is straying from efficiency to pure laziness.  Before you get all riled up, hear (read?) me out.  When you use a framework, you are accepting that it will be abstracting a lot of functionality away.  Functionality that you might not even understand correctly.  Which is great for quickly building something, but bad when you run into an error being generated by the framework itself.  Or behaviour that is unexpected. I like to call this "fighting against the conventions", and I believe that is the #1 reason why people end up not using a particular framework.  They cannot or are unwilling to follow the conventions and as a result, nothing will work.</p>

<p>
So, if you use a framework all the time, you might find that certain skills or bits of knowledge start to erode.  Use an ORM all the time?  You forget how to make finely tuned SQL queries.  Rely on built-in form validation?  You start to forget what POST requests look like.  Use the Ajax helper that comes with the framework?  You forget how to make tight, customized Javascript code.  I think you're starting to get the point.
</p>

<p>
Joel is 100% correct when he talks about that there are features in Ruby that allow you to be more EFFICIENT with your code than in PHP.  That is not laziness.  Usually when a developer calls themselves lazy, it is a self-deprecating statement.  I have called myself "lazy" because I strive to write as little code as possible to accomplish a task.  That's not laziness, that's efficiency.
</p>

<p>
The use of the term "laziness in terms of coding" is just a bad one to use.  Use the proper term, which is "efficiency in terms of coding".  "Laziness in terms of coding" is cut-and-pasting code all over the place, or blind use of code examples you find on the web without understanding what they really do.
</p>

<p>
Joel, I'm happy that you are loving Ruby.  Python gives me the same fuzzy glow on those occasions when I play around with it.  But please put things in the proper prospective.  To paraphrase the Princess Bride:  "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."

           <h3>May 14th, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Okay, so since the first book has been a pretty good success for me, I've been thinking about writing a second book.  Will be the same format:  PDF, under 100 pages, selling for between $10 and $20.  So that got me to thinking "what topic could I go on and on about like an idiot in regards to programming and CakePHP in general?"</p>

<p>
I've become a believer in Test Driven Development and TATFT practices (thanks to <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2009/05/one-way-to-escape-cargo-cult.html">Giles Bowkett</a> for his blog posts espousing the concept.  So why not combine that with my knowledge (no jokes from Nate allowed) of CakePHP and produce another inexpensive book.  Thus, the seeds of "Test Driven Development Using CakePHP" have been planted in my mind.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the book will be made easier by the fact that I have a CakePHP project on the go at work where I am using TDD, so once again I will be producing a book with code examples and comments about what I was doing.  So, I am asking *you* what sort of things would you like to see in this book about TDD and CakePHP?

        <div>
            <p>Although I never got into the habit of using online bookmarking services like Delicious (never really understood how/why to use them) I do tend to bookmark a lot of stuff.  So as a change of pace I thought I'd go through my programming bookmarks and show you some of the stuff I found interesting enough to save:
</p>

<h3><a href="http://github.com/sofadesign/limonade/tree/master">Limonade, a PHP microframework</a></h3>

<p>I am Mr. Framework (Rails, ZF, CakePHP, Code Igniter, Django, I've tried a ton of 'em) so I found this project to be very interesting.  I think it's only really missing easy-to-do URL rewriting.  I could *probably* figure it out using whatever the web server for that project uses, but I am spoiled by the easy routing stuff in most frameworks.</p>

<h3><a href="http://marcgrabanski.com/article/jquery-google-maps-tutorial-ajax-php-mysql">jQuery and Google Maps</a></h3>

<p>
Marc Grabanski is a guy I met at the original <a href="http://cakefest.org">CakeFest</a> in Orlando, and he does so much amazing front-end work that I find myself going back to his site over and over again.  This is the second tutorial he has up there on using jQuery with Google Maps.  So well written, and so easy to implement with your own stuff.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://misko.hevery.com/">The Testability Explorer Blog</a></h3>

<p>Misko Hevery has this amazing blog where he talks about great testing practices.  For the love Murphy, please go read his blog and start testing your code.  I mean it!</p>

<h3><a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/five-whys">The startup immune system</a></h3>

<p>
Great article on some recommended practices for making your company's handling of defects in the software they produce better.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://ivanidris.net/wordpress/index.php/2009/02/03/sharpen-the-vim-saw">Sharpen the Vim Saw</a></h3>

<p>
What?  You don't use <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>?!?!  That's okay, what Ivan Idris talks about here is finding inefficiencies in the way you use your editor-of-choice and eliminate them.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~cduan/technical/git/">Understanding Git Conceptually</a></h3>

<p>
Want to know what the big deal about Git is?  Why are all the cool kids using it?  Well, many of *them* don't even know why Git is so awesome.  This site explains HOW Git works so you can understand WHY you should be using it.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2006/jul/14/django-admin-your-php-app/">Django admin for your PHP app?</a></h3>

<p>
A quick guide to how to sneak Django into your PHP project as the rock-solid start of an admin area.  I have done this with a project at work at the prototype level (no code committed yet) and it just makes so much sense.</p>

<h3><a href="http://blog.johngoulah.com/2009/01/mysql-sandbox/">Quick DB Setups with MySQL Sandbox</a></h3>

<p>
Although I am lucky that I do not need to test my work code against different versions of MySQL, the techniques described here show how to do that exactly that in a way that is so simple I thought to myself "Why did nobody ever tell me you could do this?!?"</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/index.htm">Library of Free Data Models</a></h3>

<p>
This site is awesome in a very subtle way.  It shows you all sorts of samples of building relationships between things in a data model.  Want an example of how to link agents and leads together for a recruiting company? They have one. Ever wanted to see how a hotel would handle booking reservations?  They got one.
</p>

<p>Okay, last one.  I promise</p>

<h3><a href="http://rope.sourceforge.net/">Rope, a python refactoring library</a></h3>

<p>
I'm starting to get into the world of refactoring tools as I dig into Python.  Rope is a tool to let you go through your Python code and identify things that need to be refactored, like duplicate code blocks that can be combined into one.  I so wish tools like this existed for PHP, as I would use them all the time.  Add in the fact that it can be integrated into Vim, well, I've got a tool that will become an essential part of my Python toolkit going forward.
</p>

<p>
So there you have it.  What hidden gems do you have to share?
