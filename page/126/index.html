            <p>Looks like I just missed a winter storm that is currently pounding the Greater Toronto Area (Milton is on the outskirts of the GTA) so I may actually be snowed in tomorrow.  Good thing I can work from home when necessary.</p>

<p>
I had a good time in Vancouver at the <a href="http://vancouver.php.net/php_conference">conference</a>, although I really wished I could've stayed for the second day.  I want to thank Shane, Audrey, Peter and all the other organizers for giving me first-class treatment (Audrey, I still owe you that drink).  My talk was really well-attended (much to my surprise as I was up against Ilia and Derek) and I was far less nervous about it than I was when I gave this talk.</p>

<p>I have to thank some of the following speakers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gravatonic.com">Andrei</a> for putting up with me, trying to push me to eat that enormous plate of nachos, and for pointing me in the direction of the <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/">Xbox Media Center</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.phpdoc.info">Sean</a> for straightening out some issues surrounding getting paid for a magazine article</li>
<li><a href="http://www.preinheimer.com/">Paul</a> for being in good spirits despite being deathly ill (and being cool about me grabbing a menu from you like an idiot)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'll be seeing most of these same people in Chicago at php|tek, so that's yet another reason to look forward to the middle of May.  Anyhow, I managed to make a screencast of my talk and chopped it down to size for the blog.  Hope you enjoy it!

            <h2><a href="/2007/02/09/my-next-foolish-project-a-console-for-cakephp/">My Next Foolish Project:  A console for CakePHP</a></h2>
           <h3>February 9th, 2007</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>On the <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> mailing list, somebody familiar with Ruby on Rails' console functionality asked "why isn't there one of these in Cake?".  I, of course, jumped right in and said "such a thing does not exist in PHP."  Nate, of course, quickly corrected me and pointed out that PHP has an interactive mode.  Which lets you do some stuff quickly for testing purposes, but this is not enough.  So I foolishly volunteered to work on a console.  Like I'm not busy enough.
</p>

<p>
So I got to thinking about how to do this.  On the surface, it seems the easiest way to do this is to write a PHP script that takes entries on the command line, run the input through an 'eval' statement.  Sounds easy enough, and I could write that in a hurry.  I think the trickiness comes in figuring out how to hook it into CakePHP so that you can access Models that already exist.  I guess this will be something that will bother me while I'm at the <a href="http://vancover.php.net">conference</a> on Monday and Tuesday.  I'll be sure to mention it during my talk.

            <p>Want the chance to work with me?  If you live in the Greater Toronto Area (we don't pay relocation costs or sponsor people) and know PHP, we may have a job for you.  We're looking to fill at least two positions I'm aware of:  nne junior developer and one intermediate developer.  Here's what my boss said he's looking for:


<blockquote>VerticalScope Inc. is seeking a highly skilled professional programmer with extensive expertise in developing PHP and MySQL applications. The position will be focused on the custom development of vBulletin applications, CMS tools, search engine optimization, tool bar creation for our network of sports, automotive and technology sites. If you like working in a creative and fast-paced environment, please send your resume to jmillman@verticalscope.com. Please ensure your qualifications match those outlined below before applying.

Requirements:
To be considered for this role, your background should include:
? 4+ years of development experience in PHP (including hands on experience in your current/last role)
? 4+ years of experience in MySQL (including hands on experience in your current/last role)
? Experience with high-availability, clustering and load balancing, familiarity with Linux, Apache, Perl, CVS, vBulletin development experience an asset

About VerticalScope

</blockquote>

That's for the intermediate position.  For the junior position, it's the same sort of qualifications but only 2+ years of experience.  You'll be spending your time working with a small group of IT guys who are great at coming up with solutions to difficult problems.  The ability to deploy applications problem-free is critical, as you will see what it's like to deploy applications for users who don't tolerate any downtime or problems with their sites.  
</p>

<p>
We're a very small IT shop (2 programmers, 1 HTML/CSS person, 2 sys admins) so finding a person who has the skills *and* will fit in with our mix of personalities (having a sense of humour is key around here) is critical.  After all, I want to like the people that I work with.</p>

<p>
If you think that you are a good fit for us, send your resume to me at chartjes@verticalscope.com with the subject "PHP / MySQL Developer position" and I'll make sure it gets to the right people.
