            <p>The book is doing quite well, thanks.  42 copies sold as I type this.  I am going to give away one of my "Framework Apocalypse" t-shirts to one lucky random customer when I get to 100.  Feedback has been great, so spread the word about the book!  As <a href="http://www.psuedocoder.com">Matt Curry</a> pointed out in his <a href="http://www.pseudocoder.com/archives/2009/04/08/review-refactoring-legacy-applications-using-cakephp/">review of my book</a>, don't let the name fool you.  It could've been subtitled "how to think like a CakePHP developer".
</p>

<p>
So, I have a few questions for the lazyweb (aka my awesome readers).  I'm hoping they can point me in the right direction.:
<ul>
<li>At work, my boss is wondering if there is a way for us to determine *ahead* of time if queries being generated by our web service are going to really churn the database and lock things up.  Since the queries are very dynamic, I can only do so much in the caching department.  Application is PHP-based, built using Code Igniter</li>
<li>Inspired by <a href="http://twitter.com/jperras">my friend Joel</a> feel free to share your essential <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a> plugins.  Mine are <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1075">netrw</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2009">autoclose</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2507">0scan</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39">matchit</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2602">paster</a> (I use it all the time at work), <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697">surround</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273">taglist</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90">vcscommand</a> (although I have started using a git plugin that I can't find the download page for, and then a bunch of syntax highlighting plugins for <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1487">Django</a>, Git, PHP (can't remember which one), Python (can't remember which one) and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=803">Xquery</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Tools for refactoring in other languages look awesome (<a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/09/towelie-keeps-your-code-dry.html">Towelie</a> for Ruby, <a href="http://rope.sourceforge.net/">Rope</a> for Python.  What tools are out there for PHP?
</li>

</p>

<p>
Let me know via the comments what you know or find out.  Thanks and enjoy the Easter / Passover break!

            <p>Can you believe it?  My book is done and available for you to purchase.  Visit the <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/book">site for the book</a> for more details.</p>

<p>
When I started working on this book I did have an idea of how much, you know, WORK it was actually going to be.  With some help from a few CakePHP gurus I got all my code tight and working the way it was supposed to.  I guess it's only natural that I should be happy with the way things have turned out, but I'm also happy with how my initial concept seems to have played out.
</p>

<p>
Guides on how to apply CakePHP (or any framework for that matter) to a real-world problem are few and far between.  That's why I was so sure that a book that showed how to turn an old PHP app into a CakePHP powered one would be a desirable thing.
</p>

<p>
I hope you enjoy the book and feel free to send me your feedback.  I may not agree with what you have to say, but I do read every comment and email sent to me.

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2009/03/24/ada-lovelace-day-celebrating-women-in-technology/">Ada Lovelace Day - Celebrating Women In Technology</a></h2>
           <h3>March 24th, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I had no idea that I shared a birthday with one of the true pioneers of the computer industry, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>.  A few months ago a petition to draw attention to women who are excelling in technology via blogging was making the rounds.  Realizing what a great opportunity this would be to recognize many of the talented women who work in IT, I immediately signed a pledge to talk about a woman who's work in technology I admired.  That woman is <a href="http://slash7.com">Amy Hoy</a>, Javascript and UI goddess.</p>

<p>
I'm going to share a very embarrassing story with you.  I first ran into Amy during a time when I was looking at Ruby on Rails as my next step after PHP.  Somehow I put two and two together between Amy presenting at a PHP conference I went to and her presence on Rails mailing lists and the Rails channels on IRC.  I wrangled her IM address and started talking to her.  Of course, I said the wrong thing to her.  I made a joke in very poor taste about why don't all female programmers look like Angelina Jolie in Hackers.  As soon as I said it, I realized what a fucking moron I was.  It is a testament to Amy's character that she accepted my apology and even had dinner with me and a bunch of other developers while at the conference.  We still talk occasionally and I'd like to think that Amy doesn't just answer my questions to get me to stop bugging her on IM.
</p>

<p>
So why did I pick Amy?  First, she's awesome at what she does.  If you read her blog and really take a look at what she talks about, her knowledge of the domain of UI just shines through.  Plus, she really cares.  I mean, REALLY, REALLY CARES.  Cares so much she wants to grab you and shake you and tell you not only that you're doing it WRONG but here's how to do it RIGHT.  She and her husband (Thomas Fuchs, the creator of <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">the Prototype Javascript framework</a>) have this awesome consultancy going and I wish I had the money to hire them to whip up a UI for a side project of mine.  I am of the opinion that they are worth every penny they charge their clients.</p>

<p>
Secondly, Amy is a strong believer in that you shouldn't care that she is a woman.  You should care that she is a person who knows what they are talking about.  I've found places (stop it, I'm not stalking her via Google) on the internet where she has been involved in discussions about how women in the IT field should stop complaining about being looked down-upon because they are women and rise above it all.  Are women given a rough time by the sausage factory that is IT?  They sure are.  But Amy says "you're above all that shit, just go out there and do your thing."  I've mentioned Amy to my oldest daughter as a woman who's been successful in the field of computer programming, and that she would be hard pressed to find a better role model.
</p>

<p>So here's to Amy Hoy, Javascript/UI Goddess and all around character.  Enjoy Ada Lovelace Day!</p>
