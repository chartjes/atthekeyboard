            <p>
A work project is getting close to 0.1 status.  Pretty underwhelming, I know.  One of the last 'milestones' for 0.1 is taking these wonderful XML documents that my web app creates (and stores in <a href='http://www.exist-db.org/'>eXist</a> and sends them to an internal web service that reads in the XML and breaks it apart for use by a wide variety of other company applications.  This web service will accept documents via an HTTP PUT (you know, GET, POST and it's neglected siblings PUT and DELETE) so I dug around a bit on the web (ignoring one cranky co-worker's complaints that real programmers read RFC's, or at least *know* what an RFC is) and put together some code</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<pre><code>    function _publish($service, $doc) {
        $params = array(
            'http' =&gt; array(
                'method' =&gt; 'PUT'));
        $context = stream_context_create($params);
        $fp = fopen($service, 'rb', false, $context);
        $response = fwrite($fp,file_get_contents($doc));

        if ($response === false) {
            return false;
        }

        // Pull out the status code from the header
        $metaData = stream_get_meta_data($fp);
        preg_match_all("/HTTP\/1\.[1|0]\s(\d{3})/", $metaData['wrapper_data'][0], $matches);
        $code = end($matches[1]);

        if ($code == 200) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
The only tricky thing here really is the use of the <a href="http://www.php.net/end">end</a> function to grab that last match of the status codes.  I got the code for doing the preg_match from <a href"http://www.jellyandcustard.com/2006/05/31/determining-if-a-url-exists-with-curl/">this site</a> and it seems to work just fine.  The reason to use end(...) as far as I can tell is to make sure that I only get the last match of the group.  Neat little trick and the link I posted demonstrates it.
</p>

<p>
I'm also quite proud that it's cURL free, as cURL seems to be the first option that most people use when doing this kind of thing.  There is some existing code that is using cURL that I *might* refactor to use the streams-driven stuff that I've been playing with.

           <h3>January 8th, 2008</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>In the comments for my seemingly-popular post about using <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP's</a> Auth component (available in CakePHP 1.2), people have been having some questions about how the password is hashed and questions about a user registration system.  Of course, the snarky response is "go and read the source for Security::Hash() and create some of your own code", but it is easier to just give people some code so they stop asking.
</p>

<p>
I'm in the process of building out an admin area for my <a href="http://www.ibl.org">simulation baseball league</a> web site, and I created a registration system.  Here's a condensed version of it.
</p>

<p>First, I have my User model
<br />
~~~
<?php
class User extends AppModel {

    var $name = 'User';
    var $useTable = 'users';
}
~~~
</p>
</p><p>
Next, I created my controller for my users and the registration action for it
~~~
class UsersController extends AppController {
    var $name = 'Users';
    var $helpers = array('Html', 'Form');
    var $components = array('Auth');
    
    function beforeFilter() {
        $this->Auth->allow('register');
    }
        
    function register() {
        if (!empty($this->data)) {
            if ($this->data['User']['password'] == $this->Auth->password($this->data['User']['password_confirm'])) {
                $this->User->create();
                $this->User->save($this->data);
                $this->redirect(array('action' => 'index'));
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~
</p>
<p>
So, let's dissect this controller:
<ul>
<li>We're using the Auth component, set via "var $components = array('Auth')"
</li><li>We tell Auth to not ask for authentication when doing the 'register' action</li>
<li>When we detect data coming into the 'register' action (usually via a POST), then check to see if the hashed password that Auth has created from the 'password' field in our form matches the hashed value of the 'confirm password' field from our form</li>
<li>If all that is okay, we create and save our new user record</li>
</ul>
Yes, it really is that easy.
</p>
<p>
The form for this is very simple as well
<br />
~~~
<?php
echo $form->create('User', array('action' => 'register'));
echo $form->input('username');
echo $form->input('password');
echo $form->input('password_confirm', array('type' => 'password'));
echo $form->submit();
echo $form->end();
?>
~~~</p>

<p>
Throw all that stuff together and you now have a very simple user registration system.
