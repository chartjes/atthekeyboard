            <p>As I work on code using the Zend Framework for a project at work (a stats reporting system for all our forums) I noticed that a lot of static class methods are being used instead of calling them dynamically:</p>

<pre><code><br />&lt;?php
$db = Zend_Db::factory('pdoMysql', $params);
Zend::register('db', $db);
$view = new Zend_View();
$view-&gt;setScriptPath('../app/views');
Zend::register('view', $view);
$controller = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
?&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>So i said to myself "why are we using these static class calls instead of dynamically creating instances of these classes?".  Little did I know that I had stumbled upon another one of the Great Holy Wars of Programming:  static vs. dynamic.</p>

<p>Not only does this war cover static typing vs. dynamic typing for languages (PHP uses dynamic typing), but it also covers the use of static methods vs. instance methods.  50+ messages in the thread later and we're nowhere closer to solving the problem.  All I wanted to know was why we were doing it this way, and as a secondary goal to try understand when we need to do it dynamically (when the state of the object is important) and when to call an object method statically (when the state of the object that the method belongs too is not important).</p>

<p>My thanks to Ralph Shindler for pointing me at <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2001-11/03-qa-1121-mrhappy.html">this little gem</a> that tries to explain the static method vs. instance method problem.  This is one area of OOP that I hadn't paid much attention to since I had heard "static bad, dynamic good" back in my very early OOP days.  Like everything else, there is a place for static methods and a place for instance methods.</p>

<p>One of the common reasons to NOT use static methods was that it can make unit testing difficult.  Of course, you could always wrap the call to the static method so that it comes off as an instance method in your code, but that is a topic that is left to more experienced OOP developers.</p>

<p>As an aside, I've pretty much settled on the outline for the talk I'm going to be giving at php|works.  Now I'm working on some code snippets involving the Zend Framework to illustrate just what the heck I'm talking about.</p>

            <p><a target="_blank" href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> and I got our submisison in today for a component for the <a target="_blank" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> called (oddly enough) Zend_Service_Audioscrobbler.? As the name states, it's intended to allow people to access Audioscrobbler's REST service.</p>

<p>For those who don't know, Last.fm is powered by Audioscrobbler's stuff and the Zend Framework handles REST sevices very easily.? It's in the new proposals section right now.? We're keeping our finger's crossed that it gets accepted.</p>

<p>At work I'm working on a prototype for a new stats tracking system.? I want to use the Zend Framework for it...but there is no built-in authorization component.? I know, I know, I should roll my own...but do I really want to?</p>

<p>I have two choices:? figure out a way to do simple .htaccess based auth so I can continue to use the Zend Framework (it uses .htaccess already to handle rewrites) or forget about Zend Framework and go with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> instead.? CakePHP is a really good Rails clone...but given I have to write a talk with code examples in PHP I think it's wise I stick with Zend Framework unless I can't make it work.</p>

            <p>I was thrilled to find out on Friday that the <a href="http://www.phparch.com/works">php|works</a> conference had accepted my proposal to give a talk on "What PHP Can Learn From Rails."  The conference runs from September 13th to September 15th of this year in Toronto, at the Holiday Inn Yorkdale (which is across the street from the largest shopping mall in the city).  I attended last year's conference and had a <em>great</em> time.  It's a local thing for me as I live just outside Toronto.</p>

<p>I'm approaching this topic with some trepidation because, well, the Ruby on Rails framework is a touchy subject amongst some PHP developers.  As anyone who reads this blog knows, I use Rails as well.  I like it.  Is there anything wrong with liking Rails <em>and</em> liking PHP?  I don't think so.  Right now, PHP pays the bills but I certainly wouldn't say no if the right opportunity to use Rails and get paid for it comes up.  PHP is a great language for doing rapid application development, and you certainly can't go wrong with Ruby on Rails if it fits what you need.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point of all this is not to bash PHP.  It's to show other PHP developers some of the ideas that Rails has embraced and make them part of any PHP developer's toolbox.  More on the presentation as I get it together.  I'll be using coding examples from the <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> in my presentation, which is something that I'm looking forward to as well since I'm on the verge of making my first submission to add a component to the framework, Zend_Service_Audioscrobbler (a joint submission between myself and my buddy Derek).  They got my Contributor License Agreement today, which is needed to allow me to contribute things to the framework.  By signing it I am saying that all the work is original and not copied.</p>

<p>The component itself is finished, and I am just making sure all the unit tests are passing before I create the submission in the project's wiki.  The framework uses PHPUnit2, which is very similar to SimpleTest so I don't anticipate a major problem getting unit tests written for all methods.</p>

<p>So, if you're going to be going to php|works make sure you stop buy and say hello to me.  I'll be the guy being tossed out of the conference for saying nice things about Rails. :)</p>
