            <p>Recently I have been told "Chris, you're a great developer but a terrible sysadmin."  Considering how often I muck-up the box that hosts my various web sites, there might be some truth to that.  So now I'm trying to be less of a sucky sysadmin and find solutions that both myself (and my poor friend Sean who cleans up my sysadmin messes).</p>

<p>When one of my employer's <a href="http://www.autoforums.com">new sites</a> was about to be launched one of the tasks I was given was to come up with an automated deployment system instead of the do-everything-by-hand system that we have in place now.  In-house, there was already a web-based tool that would export stuff from the CVS repository but anything else had to be done by hand.</p>

<p>Being a Rails fan, I had known about &lt;a href="//manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/97"">Capistrano</a> (used to be called Switchtower but they ran into some copyright issues on that name) but was unsure how it would work with a non-Rails app.  I did manage to hack something together but wasn't entirely happy with it.</p>

<p>In the end, the project had scaled down quite a bit (only one server instead of the three they had planned for) so the manual system is okay for now.  But I was still frustrated by not having an elegant, CLI solution to deploy the site.  I had toyed around with the idea of writing my own Capistrano clone for PHP (as source material for another I googled around some more today and found that Geoffrey Grosenbach (Rails guy and main force behind the Ruby on Rails podcast) &lt;a href="//nubyonrails.com/articles/read/460"">had done the same thing, but only better</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at that blog posting makes me realize that it's possible to use Capistrano to distribute PHP apps.  Wish this had been around at my old gig...</p>

            <p>I'm a guy who believes in the value of agile software development.  My former employers never seemed to quite grasp the concept fully.  My <a href="http://www.sexsearch.com">old project</a> started off agile, but it became a strictly big-design-up-front-all-decisions-from-the-top when things came to a head.  Now, they've gotten even more process intensive and I don't think I could be really productive in that sort of environment at this point in my career.</p>

<p>Anyhow, one of the smart things that we did was create unit tests for just about every single function we had.  We used the <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">SimpleTest</a> unit testing framework.  It works well, can produce output for both web browser and command line stuff.  I'm not sure if they are still using it.</p>

<p>As my interest in PHP security has grown, I started reading Chris Shiflett's <a href="http://shiflett.org">blog</a> and he had some great info on <a href="http://brainbulb.com/agile-php-testing.pdf">Agile Testing</a> with <a href="http://shiflett.org/code/test-more.php">test-more.php</a>, a PHP port of a Perl testing package called (oddly enough) Test::More.  It uses something called TAP (Test Anything Protocol).</p>

<p>Check out the site, check out the PDF, and you will see how easy it can be to implement testing for your PHP applications.</p>
