            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2009/01/25/cakephp-nginx-configuration-update/">CakePHP + Nginx Configuration Update</a></h2>
           <h3>January 25th, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>In a previous post I had talked about how to configure CakePHP to work with <a href="http://nginx.net/">Nginx</a>, a lightweight, high-performance HTTP server.  I'm in the process of creating the website for my upcoming book *and* had recently switched back from using Apache to using Nginx again, so I thought it might be time to roll up my sleeves and figure out how to make it work in a subdirectory.  After much gnashing of teeth and pissing and moaning, I figured it out.
</p>

<p>
In this example, let's assume that we are going to be running our application out of /foo, and that we already have PHP applications running with Nginx already.  There are plenty of examples out there that you can google for.  So, what took me forever to do was to figure out how to properly make the second part of the rewrite rule.
</p>

<pre>
# configure Cake app to run in a sub-directory
# Cake install is not in root, but elsewhere and configured
# in APP/webroot/index.php
location /foo/ {
    index index.php;

    if (!-e $request_filename) {
        rewrite ^/foo/(.+)$ /foo/webroot/$1 last;
        break;
    }
}

location /foo/webroot/ {
    index index.php;

    if (!-e $request_filename) {
        rewrite ^/foo/webroot/(.+)$ /foo/webroot/index.php?url=$1 last;
        break;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
As stated before, I am not an Nginx expert so I will simply tell you what I *think* this configuration is doing.  First, it looks at any request that comes into /foo and if it can't find it right away, it then rewrites the request to go over to /foo/webroot.  Then, any requests that come in for /foo/webroot, it checks to see if it can serve the file directly, like if it was in the css or js directories.  If it can't, it then strips out everything *after* /foo/webroot in the request and passes it over to APP/webroot/index.php.</p>

<p>It was that second part that gave me the toughest time.  Once it finally dawned on me that I needed to remove '/foo/webroot' from the request, everything worked perfectly.
</p>

<p>
If there are any Nginx experts who can tweak this to work better, let me know.

           <h3>January 23rd, 2009</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>One of my favourite sayings I tell my daughter when she whines "I wish ..." (usually in response to something I've asked her to do around the house) I remind her that "if wishes were fishes, the sea would be full."  Sure, not exactly the type of advice she wants to hear but very true nonetheless.</p>

<p>
As I prepare for the <a href="http://www.printfection.com/atthekeyboard">upcoming framework apocalypse</a> I started wondering not just what it was about all these frameworks that I have tried that I liked, but what was it about them that I did *not* like.  So, in the interest of fairness I thought I'd look at the 3 frameworks I've actually been paid to write code using and what features I'd like to see in them.
</p>

<h3>Wish #1: CakePHP to abandon PHP 4</h3>

<p>
There, I said it.  I think it's time that <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> stop supporting PHP 4 and get on with the task of being a PHP 5-only framework.  Last I heard this was the plan for Cake 2.0 but I do not know the timeframe for that.  I know that a lot of people think that since 1.2 took so long to go final, my kids will be in college before CakePHP 2.0 comes out.  However, knowing how driven Nate, Garrett, and the new superstar on the block Mark Story are, I have faith that a PHP 5-only version of Cake is coming in short order.  Please tell me that's true, Nate!  Please?
</p>

<p>
Before you start complaining in the comments, please be aware that I know you can write CakePHP applications using PHP 5.  But until the core itself is taking advantage of PHP 5 (via things like autoloading and some of the more advanced OOP magic you can do) I think it's going to continue to suffer performance problems.  I love Cake and it's my PHP framework of choice, but that doesn't mean that the wizards on the core dev team can't make it better by leveraging what PHP 5 has to offer).
</p>

<h3>Wish #2: Code Igniter to abandon PHP 4</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://codeigniter.com">Code Igniter</a> is an example of what happens when a company, and the company alone, is the sole driver of development for a framework.  At least that is my impression.  Code Igniter continually scores well in all those ridiculous "hello world" framework competitions, so you know that it is not dragging a lot of overhead around when doing things.  Again, Code Igniter does not use anything available in PHP 5 to its advantage.  I know that <a href="http://kohanaphp.com/">Kohana</a> is a fork of Code Igniter that is PHP 5 only, and one of our existing applications at work uses it, so those who like Code Igniter's style but want something that is PHP 5 only might want to take a look at it.
</p>

<h3>Wish #3: Zend Framework gets a good ORM / ADM module</h3>

<p>
I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I am starting to like <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> for PHP 5-only projects that aren't database-driven.  In fact, if I have to start a new PHP project from scratch at work I'm likely to pick Zend Framework due to it's PHP 5-only pedigree and modular approach to building an application.  You literally only have to include what you need beyond a few core libraries.  Similar to Code Igniter in that respect but just a little heavier.  That's not so bad.</p>

<p>
But the reason I still like Cake is that the associative data mapping that they use for database work is flexible and easy to use.  Zend Framework needs something like this.  If there is one, let me know in the comments.
</p>

<h3>Wish #4: For the love of god, no more XML configuration files in frameworks!</h3>

<p>
One of the advantages to Cake is that there is very little you have to do in the way of configuration in order to get started.  Code Igniter has even less.  Zend Framework?  I was taking a look at Zend_Tool, which is their attempt at a CLI code generation tool, and noticed that there are XML configuration files all over the place to get it to work?  And <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">Symfony</a> has the same thing.
</p>

<p>
Look, I deal with XML all day at my day job.  It's called XMLTeam Solutions for a reason.  But we use it for one thing, and one thing only:  presentation of data.  We use XSL files to reformat the XML output generated by our application.  That is where the use of XML remains.
</p>

<p>Configuration files for our main product, a Perl application, are text.  The authorization system for our clients is text-based.  Our PHP applications use (isn't that strange) PHP files to store the configuration information in them.  The handful of Python-based utilities I've written use...text files for configuration.  Noticing a trend?  Use XML as a way to pass data from one system to another, which is really want it was designed for.  Maybe someone can explain to me why configuration files being XML is a good idea, because I just don't see it.
</p>

<h3>Wish #5: Please buy a copy of my book when it comes out at the beginning of March</h3>

<p>
I'm getting my basement renovated so I actually have a nice office to work in, instead of working in my cold basement (or from the dining room table due to the current deep freeze in Ontario).  Buy my t-shirts too!</p>

            <p>Thanks for all the feedback about the preview for my upcoming e-book "Refactoring Legacy Applications Using CakePHP".  My plan is to have the book done and the web site for it created just before I go to Montreal to talk at the <a href="http://conf.phpquebec.com/en">2009 PHP Quebec</a> conference.  Let's see if I can hit that mark.</p>

<p>
I've decided to rev back up the posting frequency on ye olde blog, so I will often be doing posts that are just quick links, or brain dumps so I don't forget things I've been working, discussing with my various online friends or trying to understand better.  So, here are some of those things:
</p>

<p>
<i>Programming vs. screwing around with HTML</i><br />
Giles Bowkett, who I follow via Twitter and his blog and I think is one of the better programmers out there at communicating his ideas, has a very interesting post about <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2009/01/haml-brings-seaside-awesome-to-ruby.html">markup in Ruby and Seaside</a>.  He compares using <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">HAML</a> in Ruby to the tradition ERB templating system.  While I might disagree with some of what Giles thinks about people who <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2009/01/why-hacker-news-thinks-php-won.html">code in PHP for a living</a>, HAML vs. ERB vs. Seaside is food for thought on programming vs. screwing around with HTML.
</p>

<p>
<i>Writing books in text is best</i><br />
While I'm certainly not the first to suggest this (Cory Doctorow has been saying this for a long time, it became obvious to me quite quickly that the best way to approach writing my book was to write it as close to the "bare iron" of text, and then rely on third-party tools to convert the output to whatever format I wanted.  So, I chose to use <a href="http://commandline.org.uk/python/introduction-restructuredtext/">ReStructuredText</a> and then installed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf/">rst2pdf</a> to have it generate PDF versions whenver I feel like it.
