            <p>I made it down to Orlando for CakeFest, and are sitting in my hotel room having had some beer and some food (bacon double cheeseburger at Denny's) before crashing for the night.  However, on the way up I did the stupidest thing EVER.  The wife and I have two cars.  For a variety of reasons, mostly owing to laziness on my part, I only have one set of keys for my car.  Which is in the driveway.  My wife's car, is in the garage.  I took my keys with me to Orlando.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  So, I have to send my keys by courier first thing in the morning so my wife can actually, you know, drive around and do stuff while I'm gone.  *sigh*.  Like I said, dumb-dumb-dumb.
</p>

<p>
So, on Wednesday I'm giving my talk "Fake It Before You Make It" where I show people how easy it actually is to use the console to "bake" your application.  I also thought I'd take the time to highlight some of the talks I'm interested in hearing:
<ul>
<li>RESTful interfaces by Nate Abele</li>
<li>Adding Common and Kung Fu UI Components to your CakePHP Applications by Marc Grabanski</li>
<li>With CakePHP & jQuery to World Domination by Felix Geisendorfer</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Of course I'll be in other talks as well but those are the 3 I'm really looking forward to seeing.

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Day 1 of CakeFest is winding down, so I thought I'd talk about today's talks</p>

<p>
First, Garrett "gwoo" Woodworth was they keynote, talking about where CakePHP came from and how he got involved with it both on a coding level and as project manager.  He included a nice little shout-out to my posting about how "the devil's in the details".
</p>

<p>
Next up was Tim Koschuetzki's talk about unit testing in CakePHP.  I'm a lapsed believer in unit tests (as in, I believe in them but still find a way to not do them) and he did a great job of showing how to do them, with some neat points about how he extended some functionality in <a href="http://simpletest.sourceforge.net">SimpleTest</a> to help test web pages.  As an aside, I also met <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org">Felix</a> and while I'm a big guy, Tim and Felix are even bigger than I am.  They grow them big in Deutschland these days.
</p>

<p>
After lunch <a href="http://www.joelmoss.info">Joel Moss</a> gave his talk on implementing database migrations in PHP.  I have experience with migrations from my Rails days, so I might investigate this for use with the IBL web site.
</p>

<p>
Then I gave my talk on using the Cake console.  It was a little shorter than I liked, and I forgot to talk about how the baked views have pagination links in them as well, but it was pretty well received.  All the pictures of my kids (who featured prominently in the slides) generated lots of laughs.
</p>

<p>
After me was a talk by Frederic Bollon about a CakePHP-specific deployment system he called Fredistrano.  Interesting talk, and PhpNut talked about how he thinks it might a viable solution to the problem he faces in updating all the Cake-related sites.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow has two tracks:  API and GUI.  Should be good...

            <h2><a href="/2008/02/02/the-devils-in-the-details-or-handling-sequences-in-postgres-in-cakephp/">The Devil&#039;s In The Details (or, Handling Sequences in Postgres in CakePHP)</a></h2>
           <h3>February 2nd, 2008</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I had been struggling with some weirdness that CakePHP has been displaying while trying to add some new features to the <a href="http://www.ibl.org">baseball league website</a>, where Cake + PHP 4.4 + Postgres were deciding to just be sulky and not work together well.</p>

<p>
So, I was trying to figure out how to make a test for this so I could file a bug (CakePHP not finding the proper name of the Postgres sequence for a table) when I tracked down <a href="http://cake.insertdesignhere.com/">nate</a> on IM to whine to him about this problem, he started bugging me about "not paying attention" when looking around in code to try and track down what I thought was a bug.  If I had looked at the API a little closer I would've been steered towards the solution he gave me.
</p>

<p>
Lucky for me, it turns out that the solution (for now) to the problem was to simply add the name of the sequence for that table as a variable to the model definition.

<?php
class Vote extends AppModel {

    var $name = 'Vote';
    var $sequence = 'votes_id_seq'; // This is what I added in

    //The Associations below have been created with all possible keys, those that are not needed can be removed
    var $belongsTo = array(
            'BallotItem' => array('className' => 'BallotItem',
                                'foreignKey' => 'ballot_item_id',
                                'conditions' => '',
                                'fields' => '',
                                'order' => ''
            ),
            'Franchise' => array('className' => 'Franchise',
                                'foreignKey' => 'franchise_id',
                                'conditions' => '',
                                'fields' => '',
                                'order' => ''
            )
    );
    var $validate = array('ballot_item_id' => array('rule' => 'numeric',
                                                    'required' => true),
                          'franchise_id' => array('rule' => 'numeric',
                                                  'required' => true),
                          'answer' => array('rule' => 'numeric',
                                            'required' => true,
                                            'message' => 'You must vote on this item')
                         );

}
?>

<p>
This confirmed to me that my new-found respect for trying to come up with the simplest solution to a problem is the correct way to do so.  Since my head is full of all sorts of nonsense (work items, family life, baseball stats, old Dungeons & Dragons adventures from my teenage years) I find that at times I am better served by taking the time to think about the problem rather than start digging around.  Especially when it comes to code that was well-written an has been tested by lots of people, like the overwhelming majority of CakePHP's core code.

<p>
Thanks again to nate for proving to me that the Devil's in the details.  And continuing to make me feel stupid.
