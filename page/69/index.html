        <div>
            <p>Before I talk about <a href="http://conf.phpquebec.com">PHP Quebec 2009</a> I wanted to let people know that my book will be out March 9th.  $10 for the PDF, $20 for a print copy via the folks at Lulu.  Site for the book should be up sometime before Friday.</p>

<p>
Later today I'll be boarding a train and traveling in style from Toronto to Montreal to attend PHP Quebec 2009, giving an updated version of my "Deployment is not a 4 Letter Word" presentation.  I'm excited as I think I've really cut it down to the essential points AND have made it funny at the same time.  I thought I'd also talk about what sessions I'm planning on attending for sure.  Of course, this may change for a variety of reasons but it's a good map of where I will be if you are trying to hunt me down and lay a beating on me or something.</p>

<p>
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Practical Zend Framework Jutsu with Dojo".  I've wondered what Dojo is, so hopefully MWOP can tell me</li>
<li>"Building RIA Applications in PHP". John Coggeshall seems to be doing lots of work with (something not PHP) talking to PHP, so it will be interesting to get his thoughts on building RIA's</li>
<li>"Stupid Browser Tricks".  I'm interested in seeing how Sean Coates uses <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo/">Komodo</a> and Firebug</li>
</ul></p>

<p>
<h3>Thursday</h3>
<ul>
<li>My own talk is at 9:55, so I will probably be chilling out until then</li>
<li>I want to see Andrei Zmievski's "VIM for (PHP) Progammers" talk to pick up a few more hints that can make my own use of the One True Editor better</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<h3>Friday</h3>
</ul><ul>
<li>"Building PHP Powered Android Applications".  I want an Android phone, as soon as I can get an unlocked one in Canada for a price that does not make me swear.</li>
<li>"eZ Components' Mvc Tools".  Derick Rethans is a goddamned superstar programmer, so I want to see  what he's been up to with eZ Components.  You never know, it might be a great fit for work since I grow weary of Code Igniter's DIY tendencies.</li>
<li>I'm going to sit in on the "Framework Comparison" session, but I dunno if I will get dragged into it to try and fight the good fight for CakePHP.</li>
<li>I will catch Chris Shifflet's closing talk and then it will be time for me to head back to Toronto on the train.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>
If you're going to be there, don't hesitate to come up to me and introduce yourself.  I don't bite, I'm usually decent company, and enjoy an alcoholic beverage or two...

            <p>
"But Chris, I thought you were a PHP guy?"  Yes, in my day-to-day work I use a lot of PHP.  However, I am branching out as required by my desire to learn new things.  One of those new things is <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, both on the web and the server side.  I thought I would share with you a tool I whipped together to do some testing of webservices at work built using <a href="http://www.sportsdb.org/sd/sportscaster">an application front-end that we have released under the GPL</a>.  Of course, you need to be using our non-free sports data feed fetching software, but that's not the point.
</p>

<p>
So, as of March 1 we are turning off an old server that uses an older, Perl-using-CGI web service and redirecting those customers using it to one built using PHP (Code Igniter specifically.  Again, this decision was made before I started at that job.)  As the lead engineer on the project (okay, the only one) I had to make sure that all the old queries would work on the new server.  When my boss told me to "manually check them" I scoffed and said "manual checking is for suckers, I'm going to write a script to do it.".
</p>

<p>
The methodology is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Make sure that calls to the old web service return properly formed XML *or* HTML with a certain string  in it when we are doing XSLT transforms</li>
<li>Do the same thing with the new web service</li>
<li>Tell me when something isn't right</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
I could do more work in this script, to do things like look for certain tags in the XML document to be populated but we can skip that for now.  The new web service has been tested quite well and we are getting back results as expected via some other tests I've written using PHPUnit.</p>

<p>
With help from online Python resources like <a href="https://comparite.ch/python-cs">this Python cheat-sheet</a> and some judicious online searching, I came up with this script.  As far as I can tell, the only outside dependency was me using <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> to read in the HTML output.  Maybe I could've used Beautiful Soup for both the XML and HTML, but this still works just fine.
</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python 

import urllib2
from xml.dom import minidom
import fileinput
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup

host = 'http://w04.foo.com';
host2 = 'http://w05.foo.com';
users = ["foo", "bar", "baz", "alpha", "omega"] 
passwords = ['xxxxx', 'xxxxxx', 'xxxxxx', 'xxxxx', "xxxxx"]
key = 0

for username in users:
    print "Doing check for " + username
    password = passwords[key]
    password_mgr = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm()
    password_mgr.add_password(None, host, username, password)
    handler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler(password_mgr)
    opener = urllib2.build_opener(handler)
    urllib2.install_opener(opener)
    password_mgr.add_password(None, host2, username, password)
    handler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler(password_mgr)
    opener2 = urllib2.build_opener(handler)
    urllib2.install_opener(opener2)

    for line in fileinput.input(username + "_url.txt"):
        try:
            data = urllib2.urlopen(line)

            try:
                xmldoc1 = minidom.parse(data)
            except:
                html = urllib2.urlopen(line).read()
                soup = BeautifulSoup(html)

                if not soup.find(text="XML Team Solutions"):
                    print "Bad XML+HTML:" + line

        except:
            print "Could not load " + line

    key = key + 1
</code></pre>

<p>
URL's that I wished to test were stored in text files that this script then read in.  Using a little grep + awk magic I was able to extract URL's from our web server access log in order to test.  I'd appreciate any tips from Pythonistas out there on how to make this code conform more to the "Python way" if there is such a thing.

<i>Book is getting close</i><br />
Circle March 9 on your calendar, as that is the day my book "Refactoring Legacy Applications Using CakePHP" as the day it will be released.  I will be offering a PDF version and a print-on-demand version via Lulu.com.  It looks like the PDF with be $10 or less, with the price of the POD version being at least double that.  More details once I get the site for this up-and-running.

<i>Book Review On The Run</i><br />
On the recommendation of <a href="http://twitter.com/lstrojny">someone I follow on Twitter</a> I ordered a copy of "Beautiful Architecture", a collection of essays and articles published by O'Reilly and edited by Diomidis Spinellis & George Gousios.  It's all about software architecture and so far it's been an awesome read.  For anyone who's ever been in a position to have a say about not just WHAT they are building but HOW they build it, it's a great read.  I'm about halfway through.
</p>

<p>
<i>Frameworks expand to fill available space</i><br />
I was thinking about this the other day.  All frameworks start out being lightweight, unless your original design calls for you to be full-stack and bundle everything including a small web server for testing.  Then, as the project matures you keep adding things to it and before you know it you are just as big and close to being full-stack as everyone else.   So to those that call certain frameworks bloated, reconsider your position and take into account what YOU add to an application built with that framework that is not already in there.

<i>7 Habits for Effective Text Editing 2.0</i><br />
Even if you don't use <a href="http://www.vim.org">the One True Editor</a>, check out this video with the creator of Vim as he talks about <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2538831956647446078">being more efficient when working with text.</a>  The strategies he talks about work with ANY editor / IDE and that's really the point.
