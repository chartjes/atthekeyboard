            <p>It's a bit of a bittersweet day here in my basement lair in the frozen wastelands of Kanuckistan.  I put in my two weeks' notice at my job that I'm leaving to go and work with the awesome folks over at <a href="http://moontoast.com">Moontoast</a>, coming on board as Senior PHP Engineer to help them continue to build out their incredibly-awesome social commerce platform.  I will continue to work from home and hopefully get to visit the Moontoast offices in Nashville and Boston. ;)
</p>

<p>
As a result of my leaving, there is an opportunity to work as my replacement at XML Team Solutions.  If you're looking for a telecommuting job where you will be dealing with sports data and using PHP, hit me up at chartjes@littlehart.net using the subject "XML Team Solutions position" and I will forward them on.  Canadian citizens preferred (for tax credit purposes) but the right candidate is the right candidate regardless of location.

           <h3>January 19th, 2011</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This posting is a lesson on the value of actually looking at the source code of a third-party library when you are trying to figure something out...</p>

<p>
I'm using Doctrine 1.2 for a Zend Framework project (loving the power of DQL) and I'm also big on continuous integration...which relies on being able to automate things.  Consequently, I was using Doctrine's <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/1.2/docs/manual/migrations/en">migrations</a> system to handle making changes to the database.  But I was frustrated.  The solution I had was running <b>each and every migration each time</b> and causing a lot of noise in the form of warnings about changes that had already been applied.  Was it hurting anything?  Just my pride and sense of Having Done Things Right.</p>

<p>So, I started searching around for solutions.  There seemed to be something missing in everything I found, some sort of smug assumption that the system was smart enough to know which migrations had already been done so you could double check.  Totally frustrated I decided to look at the source code for Doctrine itself...
</p>

<p>
"Hrm, this method seems to allow you to write a value to a table in a database...what table is that...goddamn it Chris, you are such a dumb-ass for not seeing this earlier!"
</p>

<p>I had noticed that there was a table in the database for this project called 'migration_version' but I kept ignoring it, thinking it was an artifact of an earlier attempt by me to implement roll-your-own migrations.  Little did I know that was the actual table I was supposed to use.  After some experimentation, I confirmed that I was indeed a dumb-ass and needed to start using this table properly.</p>

<p>
Next step was then to create a new PHP script to handle the migrations.  Keeping in mind that I'm using Zend Framework, here's what it looks like:
~~~
< ?php
define('APPLICATION_PATH', realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/application'));

if (!defined('APPLICATION_ENV')) {
    define('APPLICATION_ENV', (getenv('APPLICATION_ENV') ? getenv('APPLICATION_ENV') : 'testing'));
}

set_include_path(implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, array(
    realpath(APPLICATION_PATH . '/library'),
    get_include_path(),
)));
 
require_once 'Zend/Application.php';
 
$application = new Zend_Application(
    APPLICATION_ENV,
    APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini'
);
 
$application->getBootstrap()->bootstrap('doctrine');

Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance()->registerNamespace('Doctrine')->pushAutoloader(array('Doctrine', 'autoload'));  
$config = new Zend_Config_Ini(APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini', APPLICATION_ENV);
$manager = Doctrine_Manager::getInstance();  

foreach ($config->doctrine->attr as $key => $val) {
    $manager->setAttribute(constant("Doctrine::$key"), $val);  
}  

$migration = new Doctrine_Migration(APPLICATION_PATH . '/migrations');
$latestVersion = $migration->getLatestVersion();
$currentVersion = $migration->getCurrentVersion();

if ($latestVersion > $currentVersion) {
    echo "Migrating from v{$currentVersion} to v{$latestVersion}\n";

    try {
        $nextVersion = $currentVersion + 1;
        $migration->migrate($nextVersion);
        $migration->setCurrentVersion($latestVersion);
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage() . "\n";
    }
} else {
    echo "No migrations were performed\n";
}
~~~
I will explain the logic a little bit here
</p>

<p>
First, we have to do a bunch of stuff to load in our Zend Framework application.  I'm using autoloading of modules so I never have to worry about including something so long as I've followed the proper naming conventions.  Next, I create an instance of the Doctrine_Migration object, then determine whether or not we need to actually perform a migration by comparing the value in the 'migration_version' table to what the latest migration class says.
</p>

<p>
See, Doctrine is smart enough to look at all the classes you've written to do migrations and figure out which one is the latest.  The easiest way to do this is prefix the name of the file with a number, or if you are dealing with multiple developers you could go with YYYYMMDDHHMM or even a timestamp (if you're feeling l33t) as the prefix.  Anything you can do to make sure that the order of migrations is the way you want is good.  I went with a 4-digit number as the prefix.  We're currently at migration 0016.  I figure that if we get to 9999 migrations then I've probably done something wrong. ;)
</p>

<p>
Armed with the info about the last migration and the current migration, it's simple to determine if we actually need to run the migrations or not.  Problem solved in an elegant way, and no more unnecessary noise in the output from my continuous integration builds.

           <h3>January 17th, 2011</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Despite a mini-snowpocalypse turning a 6-1/2 hour drive into an 8 hour drive, I made it to <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash</a> last week at the superamazingfantastic Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, OH.  I had my long-suffering wife and two girls with me and they enjoyed themselves at the water park (okay, I liked it too) and the arcade and the dry-land park.  In the meantime, I got my geek-on at the conference.
</p>

<p>
CodeMash was probably the largest conference I've ever been at, with between 700 and 1000 people attending based on comments from other people) and I'm also used to conferences that have a pretty narrow focus.  In this case, it appeared to me to be about 50% .Net stuff and 30% Ruby, the rest being things like a smattering of PHP and Python.
</p>

<p>
On the Wednesday night, there was a meet-and-greet for the speakers and sponsors in the hotel.  I went, ran into <a href="http://twitter.com/caseysoftware">Keith Casey</a>, had a few drinks and went back to the room.  Why?  Well, ever been to a party where everybody knew everyone else but you knew nobody?  That's what it felt like to me.  This isn't the fault of the conference organizers, more a reflection on how I like to interact with my fellow speakers.  Noisy bars aren't my favourite place to meet-and-greet people, and not knowing ANYONE there made me pause as I tried to figure out who to speak to etc.
</p>

<p>But once the conference got going, I warmed up to the idea and spent a lot of time speaking to people sitting at the same table as me for breakfast and lunch, as well as those near me in the talks I attended.  Due to the distraction of the kiddies ("Daddy, come to the water park with us!!!") I didn't get to see all the talks I wanted to do, but that was the price that had to be paid.  I thoroughly enjoyed Chad Fowler and Scott Chacon's keynotes, which got me thinking about my career and my current employer, and the steps required for happiness in said career.
</p>

<p>
I attended a talk about 3d printers (it was awesome, wish I had the $2K needed to buy one and all the tools required to keep it up and running), a talk on high-performance javascript (very informative, introduced me to the concept of non-blocking Javascript loading), a talk on the "modern open source development environment" (very disappointing, didn't cover anything that I was expecting to see about using Vim + Python|Ruby, more like a criticism of slow-running tests and using GUI editing tools), and I saw about 20 minutes of Keith's unit testing talk before a phone call from wife about car trouble took me away (it was nothing major, car was fine).
</p>

<p>
My talk went okay.  I covered all my material, had a good pace...but was about 10 minutes short.  Next time I give the talk I know exactly where I need to add more material.  Not too many questions during the talk itself, but some great questions AFTER the talk.  Again, more content for the talk itself.  For those who couldn't attend, you can find the slides <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/tdd-ci.pdf">here</a> and for those who don't mind hearing me talk (and drop a few swear-words) you can view a screencast in a wide variety of formats <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/BreakItBeforeYouBuyIt">here</a>
</p>

<p>
I will definitely be submitting again next year and will be making sure to venture out of my comfort zone and view some talks dealing with technology I don't really use much.  Also, I'll be sure to check out some of the ad-hoc open sessions if I don't happen to like the talks being offered being the conventional tracks.  Upon reflection, those would've been a perfect chance to expand my mind.
</p>

<p>
I want to personally thank <a href="http:/twitter.com/wjgilmore">Jason Gilmore</a>, one of the organizers of the conference (and the publisher of my CakePHP book) for treating me exceptionally well, and for taking time out of his super-busy schedule to talk about a joint strategy for 2011 for some projects we had been casually talking about.</p>

<p>
In short, I encourage people to check out CodeMash next year, I don't think you will be disappointed you went.
