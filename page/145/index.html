            <p>Another lively round-up of things I'm thinking about</p>

<ul>
<li>ugh, this consulting gig I'm doing is cutting into my prep-time for doing slides for my presentation on the 14th</li>
<li>making more plans for my supersecret project</li>
<li>what happened to the unit tests I wrote for my Zend Framework AudioScrobbler plugin?  Gotta dig through the subversion logs</li>
<li>Comet (streaming requests from server to browser and back for things like web-based chat like Meebo) looks very interesting...and may have some applications for my supersecret project</li>
<li>SportsTicker just blasts too much info at you in their streams.  I could work full-time just parsing all the data out</li>
<li>Ruthless refactoring always shows you that what you thought you knew when you started on a piece of code is always vastly different from what you actually knew when you finished it</li>

            <p>
I'm on the CakePHP mailing list, and recently someone sent an email asking what product to people recommend to obsfucate their code.  The poster in question is going to be distributing their application and I guess he doesn't want them to be able to figure out how the application works or even look at the source code.
</p>

<p>
I replied asking why he was trying to protect his source code, and another developer jumped in calling my logic "flawed" and going into a fairly long rant about the evils of not protecting your intellectual property and support issues from people who've modified what you've worked on and expect you to fix it for them and a few other things I won't go into here.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I don't think it's worth worrying about that stuff for more than about 1/10th of a second.  If I build something and sell it to people, well, I've got licensing arrangements that prevent you from distributing my code without my permission.  I did this with a parser I wrote for Canada Post's E-parcel system many years ago.  Did the company in question copy the code and distribute it?  I have no idea, but I'm not wasting any time worrying about it.
</p>

<p>
I feel that if you're obsfucating the code and then selling it to people, you're saying that you don't trust your own customers.  That's a very dangerous business practice.  People reverse engineer how things work all the time without access to sources, so there are bound to be people smarter than me who figure out how my stuff works without asking me for the source.  I'd prefer to trust my customers and continue to produce high-quality code.  It's not the code that's worth the salary I'm being paid by my current employer,  it's my knowledge on how to create the code.
</p>

<p>
As for the support issues, well, I guess people aren't as straightforward as I would be:  if you've modified the code without me knowing about it, you're on your own.  But I suspect my attitude is very different from most other developers.
</p>

<p>
Obfuscate your code if you must, but you should be aware what other people will think of you for doing that.  Trust is a big issue, and once you lose the trust of your customers, well, you should start thinking about an exit plan.

            <p>No real focus to this post today, just 2 things to talk about.</p>

<p>
First, I got an email from the fine folx at <a href="http://framework.zend.com">the Zend Framework team</a> informing me that the proposal <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> and I had done to add a component to the core of the framework to handle talking to <a href="http://last.fm">Last.FM's</a> web services has been moved out of the proposal stage and into the incubator, which is amazing news.  This means that once Derek and I finish all the unit tests we can move the component to the core of the framework.  We've done all the hard work, and just have to make sure nothing is broken thanks to our unit tests.
</p>

<p>Secondly, I was listening to the <a href="http://podcast.phparch.com">Pro-PHP podcast</a> and they mentioned briefly a talk about 6 things that Theo S. didn't like about PHP.  One of the more interesting ones was the idea that the PHP has the worst build system out there.  So that got me to thinking.
</p>

<p>
I've always wondered why some elements were build as part of the core of the language and why some were extensions.  From a build perspective, might it not be easier to make EVERYTHING an extension beyond just some core functionality.  That way you would install the base of PHP and then all the extensions you wanted to customize your install.
</p>

<p>
Sean Coates had commented that at some point, the whole build process for PHP was going  to have to be carefully examined.  Maybe it would be a good idea to think about a system similar to the one I've talked about.  Trim the core PHP install down to a bare minimum (no DB, no XML, etc) and then make all that stuff installable as extensions.  Not that I have any idea on how to make that happen, but it's an interesting idea for the core PHP team.</p>
