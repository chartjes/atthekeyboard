        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As I continue to build out <a href="https://opencfpcentral.com">OpenCFP Central</a> I
wanted to share with you some of the work I have been doing to move it from
your typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
structure to something a little more robust -- <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a>
and <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a>.</p>

<p>So at the time I wrote this, I had two problems I needed to solve:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to refactor existing code for talk creation to support CQRS+ES</li>
<li>how to go back and create events for data that already exists</li>
</ul>

<p>Solving the first problem appears straightforward. This is a <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.8">Laravel 5.8</a>
application, so I spent time looking at some different packages that I thought
could help me implement the core features that I needed for event sourcing
quickly. My first research lead me to two solutions tailored towards PHP:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://getprooph.org/">Prooph</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eventsauce.io/docs/">EventSauce</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The problem I quickly ran into was there was some friction in using
these packages with Laravel. They both are very powerful, but you will
end up spending a lot of time writing the wiring and/or glue yourself.
That was time that I felt I did not have. After all OpenCFP Central
is a project I can only really devote 1-2 days a week on. I needed
some help to implement the basic concepts and let me build stuff
quickly.</p>

<p>Like with a lot of problems I try and solve over the years, sometimes
if you wait long enough someone else will create the solution for you!</p>

<p>I discovered that <a href="https://twitter.com/freekmurze">Freek Murze</a> had been
tweeting about <a href="https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-event-projector/v2/introduction">Laravel Event Projector</a>.
This turned out to be exactly what I needed to get started.</p>

<p>So, I need to go backwards and first figure out how do I take the
existing data we have and create events from it. The work I needed
to do will be used when I go and refactor the existing user registration
code to support the new event sourcing.</p>

<p>What do I need to start?</p>

<ul>
<li>An <a href="https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-event-projector/v2/getting-familiar-with-event-sourcing/using-aggregates-to-make-decisions-based-on-the-past">aggregate</a> that represents a talk</li>
<li>An event that needs to be triggered to create our talk aggregate</li>
<li>A script that reads in the existing data and creates those events.</li>
</ul>

<p>The aggregate looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Domain\User;

use App\Domain\User\Events\UserCreated;
use Spatie\EventProjector\AggregateRoot;

final class UserAggregateRoot extends AggregateRoot
{
    public function createUser(string $email, string $name, string $password)
    {
        $this-&gt;recordThat(new UserCreated($email, $name, $password));

        return $this;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, all I'm storing is the data about this user that is
important to the system. It will automatically create a UUID that
belongs to this aggregate. I'll worry about what ends up in the
database we will <em>read</em> information from when I create a 
<a href="https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-event-projector/v2/getting-familiar-with-event-sourcing/using-projectors-to-transform-events">projector</a>
to extract data from the event store.</p>

<p>Next, I have to create the code for the event that will
in turn generate our user aggregate.</p>

<pre><code class="php">declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Domain\User\Events;

use Spatie\EventProjector\ShouldBeStored;

final class UserCreated implements ShouldBeStored
{
    /** @var string */
    public $email;

    /** @var string */
    public $name;

    /** @var string */
    public $password;

    /**
     * UserCreated constructor.
     * @param string $email
     * @param string $name
     * @param string $password
     */
    public function __construct(string $email, string $name, string $password)
    {
        $this-&gt;email    = $email;
        $this-&gt;name     = $name;
        $this-&gt;password = $password;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It takes the user information passed into it and assigns it to
class attributes.</p>

<p>Finally, I will create a console command that I can execute
with <code>php artisan</code> that will loop through all my existing
user records, storing aggregates for them.</p>

<pre><code class="php"><br />declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use App\Domain\User\UserAggregateRoot;
use App\User;
use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid;

class GenerateUserCreatedEvents extends Command
{
    /**
     * The name and signature of the console command.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $signature = 'admin:generate_user_events';

    /**
     * The console command description.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $description = 'Set an existing user to be an admin';

    public function handle() : void
    {
        foreach (User::all() as $user) {
            UserAggregateRoot::retrieve((string) Uuid::uuid4())
                -&gt;createUser(
                    $user-&gt;email,
                    $user-&gt;name,
                    $user-&gt;password
                )
                -&gt;persist();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>UserAggregateRoot</code> uses some magic behind the scenes to
then take the data I submitted and write it to the event store.</p>

<p>So what ends up being stored in the events table? In my current
test environment I have exactly one user and here's a
slightly-edited version of what got created.</p>

<pre><code>id               | 4
aggregate_uuid   | 2b5f88da-1f51-4443-a080-c566c04d452e
event_class      | App\Domain\User\Events\UserCreated
event_properties | {"email":"chartjes@grumpy-learning.com","name":"Chris Hartjes","password":"clearlynotmypassword"}
meta_data        | []
created_at       | 2019-04-26 19:31:44
</code></pre>

<p>Again, I remind you to understand the central concept
that we are creating events that do not necessarily map
exactly to what ends up in a database. One of the central
parts of CQRS is that by separating the "command" (typically
writing something to a database) from the "query" (typically
reading something from a database). This gives me the
flexibility to have multiple database tables that can
display information in different ways. This is especially
useful for domains where multiple types of reports are
required. Multiple tables with exactly the data you need
are, in my opinion, better than one big table where you
have to create customized queries to filter out, and group,
and aggregate things you are looking for.</p>

<p>First, I need to modify the controller method that
handles user creation to create an aggregate instead
of directly writing to the database.</p>

<p>Here's what it looks like right now:</p>

<pre><code class="php">/**
* Create a new user instance after a valid registration.
*
* @param  array  $data
* @return \App\User
*/
protected function create(array $data) : User
{
    return User::create([
        'name' =&gt; $data['name'],
        'email' =&gt; $data['email'],
        'password' =&gt; Hash::make($data['password']),
    ]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what it does instead:</p>

<pre><code class="php">protected function create(array $data) : User
{
    $newUuid = (string) Uuid::uuid4();
        UserAggregateRoot::retrieve($newUuid)
            -&gt;createUser(
                $data['email'],
                $data['name'],
                Hash::make($data['password'])
            )
            -&gt;persist();

        return User::where('email', $data['email'])-&gt;first();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is not exactly normal behaviour in a CQRS+ES
application. Because Laravel's Auth system was not created
with this is in mind, I had to cheat a little to make
the use registration system behave correctly.</p>

<p>Next I need to create a projector that will be triggered
whenever the <code>UserCreated</code> event happens.</p>

<pre><code class="php">declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Domain\User\Projectors;

use App\Domain\User\Events\UserCreated;
use App\User;
use Spatie\EventProjector\Projectors\Projector;
use Spatie\EventProjector\Projectors\ProjectsEvents;

final class UserProjector implements Projector
{
    use ProjectsEvents;

    public function onUserCreated(UserCreated $event, $aggregateUuid) : void
    {
        User::create([
            'name' =&gt; $event-&gt;name,
            'email' =&gt; $event-&gt;email,
        'password' =&gt; $event-&gt;password
        ]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Alert readers will notice this is what the old controller method
used to do.</p>

<p>Any projectors you write will be automatically detected and
registered by the application.</p>

<p>So there you have it! A successful refactor of some existing
code to support a new underlying paradigm. There is still
more work to do and I'll share some of it in another blog post
soon.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I am in the process of starting the dreaded Rewrite Of An Existing Application
That Works. In this case, it is time that I turned <a href="https://github.com/opencfp/opencfp">OpenCFP</a>
from a install-it-yourself web application into a Software-As-A-Service offering.</p>

<p>As part of this rewrite I have decided to use <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a>
and <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event Sourcing</a> instead
of the traditional CRUD-backed-with-a-DB architecture that most of the
web is built on.</p>

<p>I believe that an application that has so many domain-specific events associated
with it will benefit greatly from the ideas underpinning CQRS and Event Sourcing.
Anyway, the architecture is not up for debate since I'm the one doing it!</p>

<p>This app is going to replace what I already created at <a href="https://opencfp-central.com">OpenCFP Central</a>
and I will cut over to this new one once I have implemented the two existing
features:</p>

<ul>
<li>allowing people to register accounts</li>
<li>allowing people who are running OpenCFP to use OpenCFP Central for single-sign-on</li>
</ul>

<p>Because there is so much reworking to be done with the OpenCFP code base to make it
a SaaS capable of hosting multiple events, I felt it was better to start fresh
with the code base. Especially because I now need to add all the CQRS+ES implementation.</p>

<p>The existing version of the application is a standard CRUD-backed-with-a-DB that was
built using <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a>. My research into figuring out how to
add CQRS+ES led me to believe that I did not have the requisite knowledge of the
framework to figure out how to make it work. Laravel is great in that it has lots
of packages and add-ons to allow you to quickly build something. I felt like this
was not going to help me in this case. Laravel is good! But not a great fit for
someone with my level of expertise with it.</p>

<p>So I decided to use <a href="https://zendframework.github.io/zend-expressive/">Zend Expressive</a>
as the framework to build this app. My online network of friends includes many 
people who have used the framework, and one of the best and most thorough examples
of how to build an application using CQRS+ES was done by <a href="https://twitter.com/ocramius">Marco Pivetta</a>
and it was backed by Zend Framework and uses <a href="http://getprooph.org/">Prooph</a> for
CQRS+ES functionality.</p>

<p>(As an aside, using Zend Expressive has reminded me how much I have relied
on 'batteries included' frameworks in recent years. Forcing myself to also
write glue code is actually a good thing for me)</p>

<p>So, I knew the framework, I knew what I could use for CQRS+ES. Now it was time
to install some other tools to help me build out this version of OpenCFP.</p>

<p>I was going to require some sort of tool to create database migrations
as the app gets built. I was also learning towards trying not to use
an ORM but instead something like <a href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal.html">Doctrine DBAL</a>
so I decided to also use <a href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/migrations.html">Doctrine Migrations</a>
since it can be used with our without the ORM.</p>

<p>I found some great examples of how to set things up...and it just
wouldn't work for me. The steps seemed straightforward and I highly
recommend watching Adam Culp's Beachcasts tutorial on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFvh5ZNhdOQ">configuring Doctrine ORM and DBAL</a>. I had my database configured and working.
I added in the code to allow the Zend Service manager to locate
Doctrine as required. The examples said "this should work just
fine with DBAL." 
I had the 'migrations.php' and 'migrations-db.php' file and it Just
Wouldn't Work.</p>

<p>Until I realized the key critical thing I had hand-waved and did not
think anything off -- environment variables.</p>

<p>The app is going to be deployed to Heroku, where I can set environment
variables that can be accessed by code, both in a CLI and web environment.
I use environment variables in my work at <a href="https://mozilla.com">the day job</a>
so why wouldn't I do that here?</p>

<p>This is what my 'migrations-db.php' file looked like:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);

return [
    'driver' =&gt; 'pdo_pgsql',
    'dbname' =&gt; \getenv('DB_DATABASE'),
    'user' =&gt; \getenv('DB_USER'),
    'password' =&gt; \getenv('DB_PASSWORD'),
    'host' =&gt; \getenv('DB_HOST')
];
</code></pre>

<p>When I would run the migration tool it would spit out errors telling me
it could not read the database configuration file and a bunch of other
noise that just made me grumpier and grumpier as I struggled to figure
out what was wrong.</p>

<p>Eventually I decided to see what as actually inside those environment
variables. To my surprise there were empty! Ugh. But I did know what
I could do to fix it. I would make use of Vance Lucas' <a href="https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv">dotenv</a>
tool to make sure the contents of my own '.env' file would be
available.</p>

<p>After installing it using <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> as per
the documentation, I added this code to my 'migrations-db.php' file:</p>

<pre><code class="php">use Dotenv\Dotenv;

if (file_exists(__DIR__ . '/.env')) {
    $dotenv = Dotenv::create(__DIR__);
    $dotenv-&gt;load();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the migrations tool worked just fine, and I was on my way towards
the first step of the app -- building the user registration system
and making sure authentication worked correctly.</p>

            <h2><a href="/2019/01/31/docker-as-a-testing-tool/">Docker as a testing tool</a></h2>
           <h3>January 31st, 2019</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Yes, <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a> can be used as a tool to help
you out with some testing problems. Let me show an example of
how it makes some load testing easier.</p>

<p>One of the projects I support at <a href="https://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> is
the push notification service that we run. Among the tests that
I do for them is a load test using an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autopush-loadtester">internal tool</a> 
that the developers of the service created. It is a <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a> application that runs using <a href="https://pypy.org">PyPy</a>.</p>

<p>No, I do not know why they made those choices. Further more, it
doesn't matter because I have to use it so I roll with the weirdness.</p>

<p>Installing it locally on my MacBook Pro was straightforward --
the docs even cover expected weirdness with some support libraries.
But now that I have switched over to using Windows at work I
ran into some difficulties getting all the dependencies installed
in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, one of the developers uses Windows...and told me of
the experience he had at failing to get it to work. "I just use
VMWare Player and an Ubuntu VM".</p>

<p>I tried to get that working...and ran into a bunch of issues
where I had to disable something called "Windows Defender Credential Guard". Which bugged me because I like to keep security mechanisms in place
normally. I followed instructions FROM MICROSOFT on how to do it
and VMWare Player still wouldn't run. Kept giving me the same
error.</p>

<p>Okay, on to plan B -- Docker.</p>

<p>The first question was "how do I make this work?". I theorized
I needed to do something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>find a base container of Ubuntu 18</li>
<li>get inside a running version of that image</li>
<li>install all the required dependencies</li>
<li>verify that the load testing tool works</li>
<li>make a copy of that container</li>
<li>push that copy up to Docker hub for teammates to use</li>
</ul>

<p>Some searching revealed that I could get a running Ubuntu
container and connect with it:</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm --it ubuntu
</code></pre>

<p>This downloaded the image and gave me access to it via
a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> shell.</p>

<p>With that shell, I started installing all the packages
I would need to install the load testing tool, including
adding the package repository for PyPy so I could install
it with the package manager.</p>

<p>Once I got all the dependencies installed, I made sure that
the tests could run. I even found out that there was a bug
in the documenation. ;)</p>

<p>With a Docker image that had a working installation of the
load testing tool, the next step turned out to be more
straight forward than I had thought.</p>

<p>The Docker feature I needed was called snapshots. Here is
what I did.</p>

<p>With the Docker container still running, I opened up
another shell (in this case I am using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">Powershell</a>) and used the command <code>docker ps</code>
to get the name that had been assigned by Docker to my
running container.</p>

<p>With that name I used the following command to save
a version of that container:</p>

<pre><code>docker commit name_of_container ubuntu:ap-loadtester 
</code></pre>

<p>Then I tagged the container so I can push up to Docker
hub under my account:</p>

<pre><code>docker tag ubuntu:ap-loadtester chartjes/ap-loadtester
</code></pre>

<p>Last, I pushed it up to Doker hub</p>

<pre><code>docker push chartjes/ap-loadtester
</code></pre>

<p>So now I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>an Ubuntu container I can share</li>
<li>that has all the dependencies installed</li>
<li>can be used by teammates to load test the push service</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, I emphasize that a tester with some programming
experience can create some really useful testing tools
by leveraging the same tools and environments used to
build whatever you are testing.</p>
