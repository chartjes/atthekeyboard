            <p>The summer is always the worst for me in terms of blogging.  That's when I have to run my team in the <a href="http://www.ibl.org">IBL</a>, play slo-pitch (or softball for my American readers) at least once a week, do side-jobs to help pay the bills, and spend time with the family.  Phew.  So, that leaves little time for the types of activities that lead to good blogging.  But never fear, I will continue to dispense what wisdom I can from here.  So, here's some of the things I've been thinking about.
</p>

<h2>Closures and lambdas coming to PHP</h2>

<p>
Via twitter I found out that PHP 5.3 is going to have <a href="http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures">lambdas and closures</a>.  I suggest you google around for a better explanation of what they are, but they are an incredibly powerful tool.  If you do any <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> work, you end up using them.  If you use <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, you end up using them.  I had a conversation in twitter with <a href="http://travisswicegood.com">Mr. Git Book</a> about this, where he accused me of being a "closure hater".  Believe me, I'm not a hater of that particular programming construct.  I simple expressed my feelings that given how horribly some PHP programmers abused OOP concepts, I imagine the same things happening with lambdas and closures.  Please prove me wrong.
</p>

<h2>Where The Hell Are The Easy Layout Editing Tools For Non-Designers?!?</h2>

<p>I have a side job where I am taking an existing app and converting if over to <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a>, but preserving the look and feel.  What this poor designer-challenged programmer needs is a tool that will take that existing HTML and let me edit it in a fairly intuitive way so I can fix the so-many-damn-tables-I-want-to-bleach-my-eyes layout that exists.  Can nobody help me with this?  Sheesh.  I don't want to burn up my billable hours fucking around with layouts.</p>

<h2>The Framework Jihad</h2>

<p>I need a "Framework Jihad" t-shirt.  Size 2XLT, please.</p>

<p>Yes, the arguments about frameworks will just not go away.  Which one is best?!?  Why should you even use a framework?!?!  And the more it goes on, the more ambivalent I feel about it.  I cannot think of the last time I wrote a PHP script that was NOT part of a framework.  Hell, even my Python programming has been 75% Django and 25% straight Python, but that's only to do things like loading up databases with info from a CSV file.  But here's what I think:  the Framework Jihad is winning.</p>

<p>
If you substitute "modularized code with standardized API" for "framework", would that make people feel better?  I use frameworks because so much of the infrastructure code is stuff I DO NOT WANT TO WRITE ANY MORE.  After 10 years of doing this, it's time I stopped reinventing things.  My old motto of "just build it, damnit!" requires a structure around your application to let you quickly build something. To me, that means a framework that has taken care of database access and application flow and templating.
</p>

<p>The number one complaint about frameworks appears to be that they are slow and have all sorts of overhead.  Fair enough, but I tell you what:  I'll worry about scaling when I, you know, have something to worry about.  If I get to the point where I have to worry about scaling, then I have done very well indeed.  Despite our desires, not everyone can create a Flickr or Twitter.  They are the lucky ones.  The rest of us should shut up and just build something.</p>

<p>It's just too easy to dismiss the Framework Jihad as irrelevant.  Like many things in life, dismiss it at your own peril.</p>

            <p>(Disclaimer: after trying out the demo for this application, I discovered I could get a license for it by saying nice things on my blog.  I was ready to fork out the money for it though)</p>

<p>
I cannot be the only one useless at interface design.  I know my buddy and fellow patio-laying-at-my-house-worker <a href="http://lazyweb.ca">Kevin</a> is too.  While checking out <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> I came across this great application called <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Mockups</a>, which is cool AIR app (I use Ed Finkler's so-awesome-I-actually-use-it AIR Twitter client <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a>) for (shocking, I know) doing mockups of things.
</p>

<p>
When I saw this, I said (really) "Holy shit!!!".  And started to play with it.  And quickly realized that for people like me, this is the PERFECT tool for creating mockups of the sites I want to work on.  I agonize over sites when I'm building one from scratch, so much so that I feel the "paralysis from analysis" effect I have heard others talk about.  Don't believe me that it's this cool?  Check this demo out:
<br /><br />
<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/e7htdJCvkeQ&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/e7htdJCvkeQ&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
</p>

<p>
To me, the really cool thing is that it is also available as a plugin for some of the most well-known collaboration applications out there:  Confluence, JIRA and Twiki.  For me, the desktop version is just right, as I can take those mockups I create and export them as PNG's that I can then pass onto designers for comments and tweaking.  This is a sign of a developer who is <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html">"done, and gets things smart"</a>.
</p>

<p>
It costs $79, and for the frustrated programmer who wishes he could better as a designer, this is an amazing tool to add to your toolbox.  Go try it out and give him your money!

Earlier today I say the following tweet on the-often-down-but-always-interested Twitter from <a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/">Matthew Weier-O'Phinney</a>:
<br /><br />
"What issues to _you_ see with using namespaces in PHP? Start blogging!"
<br /><br />
Since I am one who likes to share his opinion on a wide variety of topics, I thought this is a good one to prompt discussion.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespaces">Namespaces</a> are expected to be a feature in future releases of PHP.  I'm an outsider when it comes to tracking the going-on in the world of PHP internals.  So, because of that, I'm not going to comment on the actual syntax of how namespaces will be implemented or it's impact on internals.  That's not really important as far as this particular discussion goes.
</p>

<p>
Imagine if you will that you are the user of a <a href="http://cakephp.org">web application framework</a> that allows you to easily use third-party libraries by dropping them into a specific location in your application structure.  You go to use it and...what the fuck?!? Class name conflicts?!?!? ARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHH.  You proceed to post to  the mailing list for said framework, complaining bitterly about how you cannot use your favourite library with this stupid framework.  Some grumpy guy from Canada flames you in response and it spirals down from there into oblivion.
</p>

<p>
There are many programming languages that support namespaces, but PHP was not one of them.  Why are namespaces so important?  They can help to solve the exact problem mentioned in the paragraph above.  Why *wouldn't* you want such a thing?!?!  You can have 5 classes with the same name in 5 different namespaces and everything will be just fine.  Except for the fact you have 5 classes with the same name.  That's not good design, but namespaces would let you do that.
</p>

<p>
So, to go back to our little framework example for a minute, the framework could assign itself a namespace (oh, I dunno, like 'Cake') and if you happen to want to use a 3rd-party library with your application that has a class with the same name, it's all good...as long as you didn't put your own code in the same namespace.
</p>

<p>
So, to answer Matthew's original question:  I cannot think of any reason to NOT have namespaces in PHP.
