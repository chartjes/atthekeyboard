webslinginfool
or try pida
which _is_ what you wanted no?

Chris Hartjes
pida?

webslinginfool
*sigh*

Chris Hartjes
not really

webslinginfool
http://pida.co.uk/files/screenshots/pida_0-5-2_17.png

Chris Hartjes
if I want that, I can go with Textmate

webslinginfool
true
very true
actually , why dont you use textmate?

Chris Hartjes
I do use it
but you get me looking at that vim stuff

webslinginfool
ahh
a man of weak faith
tsk
tsk
tsk

Chris Hartjes
very weak when it comes to editors

webslinginfool
wait, let me halt construction of your monument
i've never met anyone like you actually

Chris Hartjes
in what way

webslinginfool
editor waffling

Chris Hartjes
yeah, that's pretty rare
I dunno why I'm like that

webslinginfool
i've never even  heard of it
you should totally add an "editors" 
section to your blog and simply detall 
your experiences
oh, and make friends with a bishop

Chris Hartjes
fuck
YOU

webslinginfool
because you'll start a holy war!

Kevin is a <a href ="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> guy, and is always giving me tips (solicited or not) on how to make my vim experience more enjoyable.  A lot of what he gives me *is* useful.  I probably have a vim setup now that will work okay for me, and I did give vim a two-week audition as my main editor a while back.  However, it didn't have the GUI file drawer / file explorer crutch that I've gotten used to.  Besides, I think my arguments about why I use each editor are just lame.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Komodo - got a free license after talking at the Vancover PHP conference last year (please, go to <a href="http://www.openwebvancouver.ca">Open Web Vancouver</a> this year so they can get enough money for me to fly business class ;)), cool editor, nice debugger...but I find it slow and unresponsive at times.</li>
<li>TextMate - one of the first OS-X apps I ever paid for, nice and snappy, great syntax highlighting...but doesn't have the tooltip stuff that Komodo does.  I did find a cool plugin that shows me what files I've modifed in version control right there in the file drawer, but it's not an IDE like Komodo is</li>
<li>vim - very powerful, pretty much does everything I need in an editor...but all those damn commands to remember, and where's my pretty GUI file explorer?!?!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Those are three of the lamest statements I've come across in my talking to people about the editor I use.  Editors are usually a religious issue amongst developers:  you can pry the one they use every day from their cold, dead hands. </p>

<p>
So, maybe it's time to grow up as a developer and stop switching between editors.  But can I do it?  Yes, I know you're not used to reading my angst-filled posts about what editor to use.  Damnit, why am I so weak on this issue?!?
</p>

<p>
This post is not intended to become a holy war on what editor to use, I'm just expressing my frustration at my inability to decide what to do here.  If I look at it objectively, it's about what tool I would be the most productive in.  The problem is, I can't figure that out...probably because I keep switching all the damn time.
</p>

<p>
Is it fear of commitment?  Fear that I pick the wrong editor for what I need?  I have started branching out into other languages, so my editor needs to support those as well.  All three can do it.  *sigh*
</p>

<p>
Komdo vs. TextMate vs. vim.  Maybe there is no winner, just a loser.  Me.
</p>

<p>
One of the thing the Pragmatic Programmers said (when not trying to get us to buy their books all the time) is to settle on one editor, whatever one that is, and learn ALL it has to offer because you might be surprised what it can do for you.  Flipping back and forth is no way to do that.  More like a delaying tactic from someone who doesn't want to HAVE to pick, maybe?
</p>

<p>
Well folks, that day has come.  I must pick and stick with it for once.  I'll let you guys know at the end of the week what I picked.  Go back to making fun of me in the other posts, okay?

            <h2><a href="/2008/03/14/whats-the-next-php-stack/">What&#039;s The Next PHP Stack?</a></h2>
           <h3>March 14th, 2008</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Most developers who have worked with PHP for any significant period of time have heard of the LAMP application stack.  <b>L</b>inux, <b>A</b>pache, <b>M</b>ySQL and <b>P</b>HP.  This is probably the most common PHP application configuration out there, and I've been giving application stacks a lot of thought these days for a variety of reasons.  First of all, I'm giving a talk on application deployment at <a href="http://www.openwebvancouver.ca">Open Web Vancouver</a>, and the stack plays a big role in that.  Secondly, I'm always looking at new technologies and trying to figure out where they might fit in.</p>

<p>
Thirdly, there seems to be a trend towards providing "drop-in-place" PHP stacks for developers trying to figure out things locally.  I'm talking about things like <a href="http://www.mamp.info/">MAMP</a> and <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">Wampserver</a>.</p>

<p>
So the next thing I've been wondering about is about what future PHP stacks will look like, at least on the open source side of things.  Have we gotten to the point where this is as good as it gets?  I know for my own personal stuff, I've started moving away from the AMP part of LAMP, instead using Postgres for database stuff and nginx as my webserver.  So, what is that now?  LNPP?  That doesn't roll off the tongue as nicely as LAMP.
</p>

<p>
Also, are we limiting ourselves in the description of a stack by just going with PHP as part of LAMP?  With the rise of Javascript on the client-side and the increasing use of frameworks by developers (I'm *not* getting into that MVC argument again) do they need to be considered as part of the stack now?
</p>

<p>
So, my question to my readers is this:  what do you see as the future stack for PHP?  Is LAMP the combination likely to continue to see the most usage?  To spark things off, here are some of the PHP stacks I've been working with lately:
<ul>
<li>CakePHP + PHP + Apache2 + Postgres + Gentoo Linux</li>
<li>jQuery + Code Igniter + PHP + Apache2 + (<a href="http://exist.sourceforge.net/">eXist</a> + Postgres) + Debian Linux</li>
<li>jQuery + CakePHP + PHP + MySQL + nginx + Gentoo Linux</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Let me know your thoughts about the PHP application stack in the comments.  I mean, are we going to see something like an application server for PHP (like Mongrel for Ruby folks) or is mod_php or FastCGI (for the nginx + lighttpd folks) as good as it's gonna get?
