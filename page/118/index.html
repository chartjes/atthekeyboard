            <p>Thanks to everyone for the great comments to my previous post on this topic.  I think I may have found the answer to what I was looking for.  Cal Evans over at the Zend Developer Zone gave me a heads-up that he would be posting a tutorial on <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/2019">using Flex and PHP</a>.  I believe my exact words to him after about 10 minutes of playing with it was "this is FUCKING cool!".  Which it definitely is.</p>

<p>
Flash at the front, and PHP at the back I think is the sweet spot for me.  I followed his tutorial (which was very well done, kudos to you Cal) and in under ten minutes from having FlexBuilder installed (30 day trial, but FlexBuilder is really expensive at US$499) I had a very simple Flex app that was talking to my Zend Framework-powered PHP application.  I built a very simple playlist editor where I could add and remove items from the playlist.  In invested a grand total of 30 minutes in playing with it.  Big props to Adobe for creating such a cool tool for "rich internet applications".  I was hoping I could catch Mike Potter's talk at php|tek but I don't know if I'll make it in time.  My flight is supposed to touch down at 11:00AM in Chicago and the talk is at 11:30...only a miracle would get me there in time.
</p>

<p>I'm thinking of seeing if I can build a media upload app using Flex on Monday for the supersecret IPTV project I've been working on since I started at Syneron.  Think I can do it?  Cal tells me that there are some open source tools out there for doing Flex work so maybe I won't have to buy it. :)  Hey Mike Potter, can't you help a developer out and get me a free copy of Flex Builder? :)  Check out <a href="http://flex.org">the Flex web site</a> to see what might be the next wave of internet applications.  Flash is pretty much the only cross-browser technology that always works the same.  Or so I've been led to believe.

            <p>"After PHP 6, I think that's it for PHP."  Those words were spoken to me by my boss while we were having lunch at the crazy-busy sushi buffet restaurant near the office.  I choked a bit on my food.  After all, my boss is a former Zend employee and utterly competent PHP programmer.  "There's no innovation going on in the language."</p>

<p>"Well, what sort of innovation do you think Rasmus and the boys should be doing?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"It's not about the language, because there is lots to like.  It's the tools.  Ever watch a .Net programmer build something?  Visual Studio is the best tool around for building applications.  Things like Zend Studio and Komodo are 10 years behind.  You're struggling with the interface for that playlist editor, right?  There should be drag-and-drop interface tools that integrate with your PHP code.  Your friends from ActiveState should be trying to one-up Visual Studio, not building tools for script kiddies."</p>

<p>Having never seen a .Net programmer at work, I'll have to take Daniel's word for it.  But he does have a point.  It's clear to me that Adobe and Microsoft have decided the best way to dominate the internet is to ignore those pesky developers and instead try to turn designers, who know how to build decent interfaces, into developers as well.  Adobe Flex and the new Microsoft Silverlight are perfect examples of this, and are even stealing ideas from the while Getting Real crowd:  build the interface first, then plug in the code behind it.</p>

<p>So I ask you, where are the tools to turn guys like me into passable interface designers?  Why do I have to code Ajax interfaces in PHP by hand?  How much time am I going to have to waste trying to code Javascript and integrate things like TinyMCE into my applications.  Where is Visual Studio for PHP?  Or, more importantly, does Visual Studio let you do drag-and-drop interface design with PHP?</p>

<p>Of course, now I wonder if Daniel is right.  Should I be learning other tools?  The answer is, of course, yes.  I'm already doing that by my commitment to learning Javascript to make all this Ajax stuff work properly.  But what about PHP?  Did PHP make a mistake by making such a bold leap from PHP 4 to PHP 5?  Possibly.  Converting an app from PHP 4 to PHP 5 is usually simply not doable, because if you are really going to take advantage of the new features of PHP you have rewrite your app.  Having worked with PHP 5 for a while now, I have to agree.  Yes, your PHP 4 app can run on PHP 5 but what do you gain?  Not much.</p>

<p>So what should I do know.  Ruby on Rails?  For all the neat stuff going on, it's still such a very small part of the web development world, and I still have my doubts about how you scale out a Ruby on Rails app.  Yes, I know, build it first and worry about it later, but I think it's still a valid question.  Is it time to learn how to use Flex?  Is it time to leave the cozy confines of OS-X and go over to the Microsoft world? What is out there?  When I'm at php|tek next week I'll start asking some questions of developers there to see what they think.</p>

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2007/05/04/form-validation-with-jquery/">Form Validation with jQuery</a></h2>
           <h3>May 4th, 2007</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Now that I have to actually design interfaces for other people, I am learning the finer details of Javascript.  Specifically, I'm using <a href="http://jquery.org">JQuery</a> as my library of choice.  I won't go into why I'm using, just go to the site and see it for yourself.  One of the things I've had to build recently is a playlist editor for the IPTV project.  I decided to be user-friendly for once, and make it Ajax-powered.  So this meant a lot of work creating small little actions in my Zend Framework code to accept form posts, etc.  Still cleaning things up, but I wanted to share some of the coolness from using a <a href="http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/">jQuery form plugin </a>.</p>

<p>
So, never having really done any Javascript form validation (I know you're shocked) I unleashed my inner "programmer" to go and hack away at it so I can figure it out, then call back my inner "developer" to make the code elegant and compact.  It took me all morning but I figured it out thanks to Google and just hacking away at it.  One of the neat things about Javascript is that it supports the ability to dynamically define functions in your code.  With it's extensive use of callbacks, jQuery leverages this to the hilt. I believe this is what the Ruby crowd refers to as "blocks and closures".  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  Okay, so here's some code that illustrates how I was doing validation of the form:
<br />
~~~
function saveBinary(playlist) {
    var options = {
        beforeSubmit: validateBinary,
        success: function() {
            $("div#media").load("/elostv/getBinaries/playlist/" + playlist);
            $("div#editMedia").html('<div align = "center"><br />Added media </div>'
                + '<a onclick="addBinaries(\'' + playlist + '\')">Add media</a>');
        }
    }

    $("#addMedia").ajaxSubmit(options);
}
~~~
</p>

<p>
Isn't that nice?  Compact, simple, readable.  All the things a developer strives for.  In summary, the .ajaxSubmit() method lets you define a bunch of callback functions as part of the submission process.  The 'beforeSubmit' is used to handle validation, while the 'success' is stuff that gets triggered if the form submission comes back ok.  Here's the validation code (again, very simple and I'll save the advanced regex matching for the beta).  Here's the validation callback:
<br />
~~~
function validateBinary(formData, jqForm, options) {
    var allFields = true;

    for (var i=0; i < formData.length; i++) {
        if (!formData[i].value) {
            allFields = false;
        }
    }

    if (!allFields) {
        alert('Please fill out every field in the form!');
        return false;
    }
}
~~~
</p>

<p>
Now that I've done this once, I imagine the second time around will be much easier.  Trying to keep things simple when you're on a very tight schedule can be difficult, and I think I've done that despite a few missteps while trying to figure out what jQuery plugin to use to handle my form stuff.</p>
