            <p>Dune is probably my favourite science-fiction novel of all time.
It's in a cool settings, with some really well-designed characters,
and is a sprawling epic in the way that sprawling epics should be.
In that book, the main character Paul Atreides learns the ways of
the mysterious Bene Gesserit through his mother. One of the things
he learns is called the <em>litany against fear</em>, something they say
to themselves whenever they are in danger:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I must not fear.</em> Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the
  little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I
  will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone
  past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has
  gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Living on the bleeding edge of technology means you spend a lot of
time trying to convince the people around you that this awesome bit
of technology that you've noticed is worth investigating. I
remember being mocked and dismissed over my thoughts on
<a href="http://www.memcached.org/">memcached</a> in 2003. And being mocked
and dismissed on my thoughts on how valuable writing automated
tests could be for an out-of-control code base in 2004. It's now
2011 and both of those things are considered integral parts of best
practices for web applications.</p>

<p>Some of the problems I faced were due to an abrasive personality
very early in my programming career (although some would argue that
not much has changed) that resulted in ideas being rejected because
of who the messenger is. Let's be honest, we've all done that:
dismissed information because of who was delivering it. I've gotten
used to facing the uphill battle to get my particular set of
programming practices accepted but it is a battle I'm winning.</p>

<p>But there is often another reaction to new technologies. That
reaction is fear. Fear of working with a set of technologies they
are not comfortable with. Fear of automated systems deploying code
that might not be adequately tested. Fear of putting effort into
things that provide very little benefit in the short-term but lots
of benefits in the long-term. Fear is the mind-killer, the little
voice in your head telling you that you are not good enough, that
your ideas are crap, that you have no idea what you're talking
about.</p>

<p>Seth Godin talks about how when a technology has been labeled dead
that
<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/03/bring-me-stuff-thats-dead-please.html">the real cool stuff can happen</a>
with it. PHP has been labeled dead by the "drive-by technorati"
that Mr. Godin talks about, despite the fact that it still
well-positioned as a tool to be used when building web
applications. At the same time, I can feel that tickle of fear in
my brain. "Don't get left behind" is whispers to me. "Drop PHP for
Technology X" it pleads to me. When the voice gets too loud, I
start reciting the litany against fear. There is still lots of
innovation to be done within PHP itself. Each successive release of
PHP is getting faster and (quite correctly) implementing features
that have made other scripting languages interesting. Exhibit A?
<a href="http://ca.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">Anonymous functions</a>,
allowing for some very interesting code to be written. It's an
integral part of the newest <a href="http://lithify.me/">breed</a>
<a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony">of</a>
<a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2">frameworks</a>.</p>

<p>Don't let fear dictate the technologies you use. Today, I am most
comfortable building web applications using PHP with some
Javascript thrown in to improve the user experience. Tomorrow, it
will be a different story. Not literally tomorrow. You know what I
mean. I've been adding Python,
<a href="https://github.com/chartjes/ibl">Django</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/chartjes/liesitoldmykids">Flask, and Google App Engine</a>
to the skill set. To be blunt, being a mono-ecosystem (ie PHP only)
specialist is a very risky for someone with the "Jack of all
trades" career path such as mine. Far better to be
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">standing on the shoulders of giants</a>
than to just stay only where you are comfortable.</p>

<p>I guess the point I'm trying to get across is that you can use the
<em>litany against fear</em> as a tool to motivate to truly analyze your
reactions to situations. For example, I'm having a very hard time
figuring out how to get Zend Framework + PHPUnit to adequately test
the ability of an application at work to use Facebook Connect. I
just can't get it to do things with a regular request, for a bunch
of reasons I'm unable to understand. I can't peer inside the
request to the extent I would like. I foresee having to drop down a
level in the application and admit that I cannot test the request
itself, but the code that is executed after control is returned to
the application.</p>

<p>Fear would say "give up because it's too hard to properly test
things". The reality is that while I cannot test the <em>output</em> of
the request, I can certainly test what is supposed to be going on
behind the scenes. Tests like that are just as valuable as being
able to capture the response from a request and verify that
elements exist in the DOM as expected. Perhaps one day there will
be better tools in PHP to accomplish this task. I know it can be
done
<a href="http://opensoul.org/blog/archives/2009/03/05/testing-facebook-with-cucumber/">using other tools</a>
and I'll be honest here: it makes me bark out a few choice words
about the state of PHP testing tools.</p>

<p>So, here's my second Idea of March: Fear is the mind-killer for
your skill-set.</p>

            <p>Any programming language is only as good as the community leaders
that back it up. For every opinionated douchebag (I've been called
that) that is being promoted as a "thought leader" there are, what,
1000 people hanging off their every word? I've been involved in the
PHP community for a long time, and despite my occasional thoughts
that I am a D-level celebrity in the PHP ecosystem, I realize that
as someone who has some sort of name recognition that it's
important to continue to share my thoughts about PHP.</p>

<p>The recent move by Twitter to wrest control of how tweets are
presented by basically telling people "don't make any new clients
and we'll shut down any clients that don't show the ads we are
planning on introducing" reminded me of just how much I make use of
blogs to help me solve problems. I'm sure I've spent man-years
rummaging through results from search engines trying to find
insights into how to solve a particular problem. While I don't
spend a lot of time analyzing the access logs for my own blog, I am
continually amazed at how often older blog posts of mine are read.
Although I might not use the framework or technology addressed in
that blog post any more, I'm happy that others are gaining value
from my experiences.</p>

<p>Chris Shiflett has kick-started a trend to
<a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2011/mar/ideas-of-march">blog your longer thoughts rather than spread them out via Twitter</a>
and I happen to agree with him 100%. Twitter's recent decision to
grab control of the presentation of messages sent using their
service reminded me that blog posts are still my preferred way of
getting across my thoughts on technical issues. If I didn't care so
much about my blog, I wouldn't have put all the effort I did into
converting it into a static blog from WordPress. As a result of
this, I'm throwing my hat into the Ideas of March concept. My
pledge is to blog something every other day until the end of this
month. It might be short. It might be a long rant if I have the
energy once the kids are safely tucked into bed. But it will always
be entertaining. My first discussion is a very personal one.</p>

<p>My relationship with the PHP community waxes and wanes, depending
on my commitment to learning other things. I look at someone like
<a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/">Travis Swicegood</a> who has shown
me the path on how to keep multiple feet planted in various
communities. Travis is an old PHP guy, but now slings Python in the
day job for <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/">The Texas Tribune</a>. He
also wrote what a lot of people consider to be the most practical
guide to
<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git">using Git</a>.
I was honoured that Travis asked me to be an early reviewer of the
book, but it shows that you can be a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">polymath</a> in more than one
community.</p>

<p>Travis' success (I know you will read this Travis, don't be modest
about what you've done) has gotten me to start considering my own
path. I joke that my career path is pushing me towards "Jack of all
trades, speaker of none" (owing to my current streak of not being
accepted to speaking at the major PHP conferences) but it is a path
that a lot of people need to consider. Being a well-rounded
developer is great for whomever is signing my paycheques, it's not
so great if you are constantly seeking attention for your
accomplishments. Despite what some people might think, ego
gratification is not the things that drives me. It's the quest to
learn more things. The quest to expand the skills so that when
someone asks you to do something you can say "I know exactly how to
do that" and also knowing "I don't know how to do that, but I know
where I can find out."</p>

<p>Once you expand the horizons, blogs become all that more important.
Where else can I found out what BDD tools are available in Python?
How are people doing deployment these days in Ruby? What tools
exist for converting a document written in Docbook into ePub and
Mobi? If I only stay within the Garden of the Elephpant I miss out
on so many other things. I want to write a non-trivial Django
application. I want to find a problem for which concurrency is the
solution. I want to learn how to read white papers on things like
Dynamo and figure out how to implement those ideas in a programming
language. I joke with my wife that I'll never retire because there
is just too much to learn, too much to know, and that furnace that
burns in my belly to accumulate knowledge never stops needing to be
stuffed full of fuel.</p>

<p>So I wish to raise a virtual toast to the polymaths and that
budding polymaths like me. It is because of people like them I am
able to fill my mind with all sorts of interesting information and
encourage me to look outside the warm, comfy confines of the
programming community I have been a part of since 1998. Don't be
just a PHP developer. Become a DEVELOPER.</p>

           <h3>February 27th, 2011</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><em>(I would like to apologize for blasting all my RSS readers with EVERY SINGLE POST on this blog when I set things up. The new template for the feed is different and I guess it forced changes on everyone. I didn't intend to do it that way, and I'm sorry for any problems it causes my readers)</em></p>

<p>I've been using WordPress for a long time. It's served up 5+ years
of blog content with very few problems. But with each release of
WordPress, I find myself asking the question "is it worth dragging
all this extra functionality around with me?" I've come to the
conclusion that the answer is no.</p>

<p>Code generation is a programming technique that I think is both
unappreciated and under-utilized by programmers. Naturally, when I
started looking into turning my blog into static pages (I feel like
it's a really good fit for what I'm doing) I looked at solutions in
both Python and Ruby. In the end, I settled on
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>Then I headed to my
<a href="http://duckduckgo.com">favourite search engine</a> and looked for
examples of how to convert a WordPress blog into a Jekyll blog. I
ended up finding this
<a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll">awesome blog post by Paul Stamatiou</a>
that provided me with pretty much all the information I needed. His
"here's all the things I wanted to do and how I achieved them"
worked out really well for me. I even used his
<a href="https://github.com/stammy/jekyll">own fork of Jekyll</a> to build the
new version of this blog. If you follow his instructions and
advice, I don't think you can go wrong.</p>

<p>Not everything went 100% smoothly of course. I had to tweak things
because I was running my blog out of a subdirectory instead of out
of the root. That meant I had to pay attention to the value for
base&#95;url in the Jekyll configuration file, and I also had to be
careful of what I put in my Nginx configuration.</p>

<p>The big changes were to the WordPress migration tool that was
provided. I hacked it to automatically add a header to the post and
to also play with the
<a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/yaml-front-matter">YAML Front Matter</a>
details inside each post. I had decided to use
<a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> for my comments and it took me a while
to figure out how to provide the proper reference values for the
Disqus javascript to find the comments since they had originally
been imported via a WordPress plugin.</p>

<p>I also had to deal with needing to change how syntax highlighting
worked. I had been using a plugin that supported
<a href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/">GeSHi</a> but Jekyll has support
out-of-the box for using <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a>, a
Python-based syntax highlighter. Armed with a little Perl one-liner
skills I quickly search-and-replaced all the old syntax
highlighting tags with the new pairs that I needed.</p>

<p>Now, my blog sits on my laptop and I edit the posts in Vim. When
I'm ready to check things out, I get jekyll to generate the blog
pages for me and I check them out using the local development
server. When I'm happy, I then fire up the deploy shell script that
I use (which runs jekuyll and then uses rsync to push the files up
to my blog) and BOOM I'm done.</p>

<p>I'll be keeping an eye out for any weirdness with the blog and I
hope to make some subtle changes going forward. Doing it as a
static site means I can experiment with the layout from
time-to-time like
<a href="http://blog.peepcode.com/tutorials/2010/about-this-blog">PeepCode has done</a>.
It's always good to learn new skills, and now I can add "static
page generation" to the toolkit.</p>
