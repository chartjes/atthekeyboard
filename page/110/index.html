            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2007/08/17/cakephp-resources/">CakePHP Resources</a></h2>
           <h3>August 17th, 2007</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As my friends find out that I work for <a href="http://www.cakedevelopment.com">Cake Development Corporation</a>, they start asking me what resources I use in order to get my work done.  Since I don't have any essays to share, or tutorials for you this week, I'd thought I'd spend some time sharing some of my favorite resources.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://manual.cakephp.org">The CakePHP Manual</a></i> is the first place I go when I need to remember how to use some pretty basic, non-advanced functionality.  For all the pissing and moaning about the lack of documentation for 1.2.x, the manual is still a great resource.  When will the documentation be ready? When it's ready!</p>

<p>When the manual isn't enough, I venture down into the bowels of the code and visit the <a href="http://api.cakephp.org">online API</a> so I can see if a particular class / component / whatever has a method I think it has and what parameters it can accept.  As awesome as the API is, I think it would be very helpfull if there were examples of using a method right in the API.  Next time I add something into the core I will be sure to include an example right there in my <a href="http://phpdoc.org">docblock</a></p>

<p>However, nothing beats actually having examples on how to do something with CakePHP.  Once I found out about <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org">the Bakery</a>, it was like I had found a chest up in an attic with all sorts of cool stuff inside it.  Lots of examples, and when you're an insider like I am (heh) you can even see articles that hasn't been published yet.  If you are looking for specific examples of doing stuff in both 1.1.x and 1.2.x then your first stop should be the Bakery.</p>

<p>I am on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php">CakePHP mailing list</a>, where I have earned my nickname 'GrumpyCanuck' that I use on various IRC channels on freenode.  Getting help via the mailing list and IRC comes with some baggage though.  Do your research before you ask, or else you will be either flamed or outright ignored.  Nobody wants that, they want answers to their questions, right?  I may come across as grumpy on the list but when you show you've put the work into trying to find an answer you will be surprised how quickly people rush to help.</p>

<p>Then I start using Google itself, finding interesting information all over the web.  There are very few CakePHP blogs that I go to all the time (I read a lot of aggregating feeds, so that does the work for me) but the one I find myself constantly coming back to is Felix Geisend?rfer's <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org">ThinkingPHP And Beyond</a>.  Tons of code exampes and excellent commentary.  Almost as good as this blog (hah!)</p>

<p>But of course, I'm super spoiled because I have direct access to many of the core developers of CakePHP, such as Larry Masters (PhpNut), Garrett Woodworth (gwoo) and Nate Abele (_nate_).  Without being able to talk to those guys via IM or on IRC, so many of my problems learning how CakePHP works at more than a basic level would not have been solved.  So, it never hurts to suck-up to / cultivate relationships with some of the more senior members of the CakePHP community.  They are usually more than glad to help you out when you have questions and can speak to them directly.</p>

<p>
So, as baseball season starts to head towards a finish (between my long-running simulation baseball league, coaching girls baseball and playing men's 35+ slow-pitch) I will finally have some time to give back to CakePHP.  There are some tickets in <a href="http://trac.cakephp.org">CakePHP's trac site</a> with my name on them that I need to get to and hack away at them, along with adding functionality to my CLI console for testing things.  Also, rumours of a CakeFest conference for later this year have me motivated to get a bunch of stuff done so I have something to give some talks about.</p>

<p>
So, if you have any other resources you like to use for CakePHP, feel free to put them in the comments and if we get enough of them I will do a follow-up post.</p>

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2007/08/14/extraction-vs-design/">Extraction vs. Design</a></h2>
           <h3>August 14th, 2007</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>For those not familiar with the history of the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> framework, it's interesting (well, at least to me) to note that the framework grew from extractions from working on <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>, an online project management / collaboration tool.  Basically, they took functionality from Basecamp (the "extraction") and used it as components for Ruby on Rails.  This is probably a gross oversimplification, but this is not a blog posting about how Ruby on Rails was created.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (the driving force behind Ruby on Rails) is a huge believer in using extractions as a method to add functionality to your projects, typically in the context of a framework.  You need some particular functionality, you write it, and if it's good enough you extract it from it's original context and make it generic enough that it can be used by other people.  You could also call this "building stuff you need" instead of "building stuff you think you might need".  It's part of the whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI">YAGNI</a> philosophy of programming, I guess.</p>

<p>
So, the flipside to this idea of how you get new features is doing it by design.  This is where you sit down and decide "I'm going to write a component to interface with Frammastat's Whoozinator API because I think some people would like to have that".  So, you sit down and you bang out the code so that users of GrumpyFramework can now talk to Frammastat's Whoozinator via a component instead of writing their own.  It's like what I did when I helped write code for Zend Framework to talk to Last.fm's Audioscrobbler service.  I didn't need it, but a friend thought it was a good idea and it was a chance to learn how to use Zend Framework.  I received a patch request for it the other day, so maybe I should go and take a look at it... :)</p>

<p>
Anyway, where was I?  Oh yeah</p>

<p>
In this case, a decision was made to build something specifically for a project, whether it was required as part of my current work or not.  Did I need that Frammastat interface for GrumpyFramework?  No, but somebody else might.  And that, in my opinion, leads down the road to premature optimization and feature creep.  Just because you *might* need something, doesn't mean you should spend the time and effort to write some code for it.  Often times, design makes sense when you know that the vast majority of users of your project will need something.  But for a lot of things, wait until you actually need them.</p>

<p>
I have found that the best bits and pieces of code that I have used with <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> have come from people extracting ideas they were using for their own personal projects and then putting a good spin on it so others could use it. Of course, it helps that CakePHP lets you create components and behaviors (that talk to controllers and models respectively) so that you can extend functionality without rewriting any of the core, but I remain firmly convinced that the extraction of ideas from current projects is the best method of adding new functionality to an existing application.

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2007/08/07/stupid-cakephp-controller-tricks/">Stupid CakePHP Controller Tricks</a></h2>
           <h3>August 7th, 2007</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>A big shout-out to my <a href="http://cake.insertdesignhere.com/">favourite typist</a> for showing me some of these gems, which I will gladly share with you</p>

<p>
So, one of the things that often happens in CakePHP is that you will have multiple values to send to your view, so you might have code that looks like this:
~~~
$this->set('user', $this->User->read(null, $id));
$this->set('foo', $foo);
$this->set('bar', $bar);
$this->set('baz', $baz);
~~~
Seems simple enough, yes?  Once when I showed code similar to this to the above-mentioned typist, he said "ew" and showed me two neat little tricks to make the code (a) more readable and (b) a little more efficient.  
</p>

<p>Solution one?  Use <a href="http://www.php.net/compact">compact()</a> to pass all the variables to your view.
~~~
$user = $this->User->read(null, $id);
$this->set(compact('user', 'foo', 'bar', 'baz'));
~~~
</p>

<p>
What does the compact() function do?  It takes the array you pass into it and looks for variables of the same name as the elements in that array.  It then spits out an array of key => value pairs.  So, one little trick with compact() means you only have to use one set statement.  This works because all those $this->set() statements simply add those values to an array.  But you already knew that, right?
</p>

<p>The second solution is similar to sing the "chmod 777 firehose" to solve UNIX-based permissions problems.
~~~
$user = $this->User->read(null, $id);
$this->set(get_defined_vars());
~~~
Now, while this looks neat it does come with one big caveat:  if you use <a href="http://www.php.net/get_defined_vars">get_defined_vars()</a> you will be passing a lot of stuff into your view that you might not want there.  In a way it's like using REGISTER_GLOBALS in your CakePHP.  Every variable you've defined in the controller (and some other ones that CakePHP has defined for you) in your current scope will be available in the view.
