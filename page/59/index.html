            <p>The fall and winter are really the time of year when I can sink my virtual teeth into side projects.  During the summer I'm too busy playing softball or games in my <a href="http://www.ibl.org">simulation baseball league</a>, so now that both seasons are done or winding down I can take a look at a side project that's been percolating in my brain for several years.  Late last night I pushed an extremely rough and not-completely-finished version of my application, which I call <a href="http://www.rallyhat.com">Rallyhat</a>.</p>

<p>
It's build using the latest official version of <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> (which is 1.1.1 as of this writing) and originally I thought of putting up on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> long-term.  I did, and it was a hacked-up version of the app without the proper registration links working.  When you add in that I was using a patched version of Django in order to just run on there, I decided it would be smarter if I used regular Django.  You know, learn how the damn thing actually works.  And run it on an environment close to what I would expect, which is Apache using mod_python.  I will probably tinker with it to get to work with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">mod_wsgi</a> as a next step.
</p>

<p>
So, in order to stop procrastinating I decided to put what I actually had working up onto the web for people to see.  Warts and all.
</p>

<p>
The idea for the site is allow people to plan activities that involve them going from one place to another.  Think baseball road trip.  Think pub crawl.  Think anything where you need to go to a bunch of places in sequential order.  Your membership in the site will allow you to save those searches to review later.  I've been toying with allowing members to look at ALL searches made by people, but there might be some privacy issues related to doing that.  You might not want people to know what you're planning. ;)
</p>

<p>
The resulting interface will be slicker, better annotation on the points you've selected, etc.  It's really rough right now so don't think this is the final version or anything. ;)
</p>

<p>
So check it out and play with it.  Don't worry if you break something, hopefully I can learn enough to fix it. ;)
</p>

<p>
In my next post I will share some of the code I was using, sort of mini code-review if you will to make sure I am on the way to writing idiomatic Python (or Javascript in some cases).

            <p>(Personal note: wow, 2 weeks since I blogged something.  Can you tell I've been in refactoring mode, not writing new code for work projects and finishing off my <a href="http://www.ibl.org">simball league season</a>. (Go MAD!))</p>

<p>
The intertubes have been all clogged-up with news about Google opening up limited access to <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a>, and I am not too proud to admit that I attempted to get an invite by following certain people on Twitter.  They never came through with that invite though.  Oh well.
</p>

<p>
As cool as Google Wave appears to be, at it's very core I believe that it is a solution look for a problem.  The solution as far as I can tell is a real-time mailing list where you can imbed all sorts of things into it.   I imagine the technology behind it is very impressive (even noticed my friend <a href="http://marcgrabanski.com/">Marc Grabanski</a> commenting on Twitter that it appears to be using some of his open-sourced jQuery code) but I can't help but wonder what problem is this solving?
</p>

<p>
Is it a competitor for things like IRC or <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a>.  I look at Google Wave and think to myself "wait until the spammers figure out how to exploit this".  Perhaps a very cynical view, but I think it's a realistic one.  But most of all, what problem is this solving that already exists?
</p>

<p>
As software developers, we all have lots of ego.  It's what allows us to ignore mountains of code that provides solutions to the problems we face and instead plow ahead recreating those solutions because we are convinced that our problem is unique and existing solutions are unsuited for the task.  Sometimes this is even true, and I tip my hat to those developers who create these kind of solutions.  What category Wave belongs in depends on factors that are totally out of Google's control.
</p>

<p>
Before you get all "you are nothing but a hater, you old curmudgeon" I understand that technologies spring forth that end up being revolutionary.  They often solve existing problems in very subtle ways and then some sort of tipping-point-event happens that shows how useful it is.  Twitter is like that, having become a microblogging service that many people have figured out how to take advantage off (including myself).  Until I can figure out the tipping-point-event for Wave, I remain convinced that it is a solution looking for a problem to solve.   With any broadcast method on the net, the spammers WILL figure out a way to exploit it unless you can prevent people from having to hear their messages.  Twitter is great for that because you can just ignore the spammers (which a lot of them don't seem to understand or even care about).
</p>

<p>
Google Wave reminds me of IRC with a prettier wrapper around it via a web-based interface.  Is that really that earth-shattering?  Not to me it isn't, but I am thinking that I am not the person that Google Wave is being aimed at.
</p>

<p>
If you care to, let me know in the comments why I should take a second look at Google Wave.

            <p>Can you tell I have nothing earth-shattering to talk about?  Here are the two things taken up processing space in my brain</p>

<h3>I won't use frameworks without built-in testing support any more</h3>

<p>
I'm doing some very hairy refactoring of code at work to support a new concept of ownership of content generated by the application.  If I had been honest with myself and started the project with TDD practices, I'd be in much better shape.  While <a href="http://codeigniter.com">the framework that it was built with</a> is all the things it talks about, it is a non-trivial task to add a testing harness to it.  I'm trying to setup <a href="http://jamierumbelow.net/2009/08/11/setting-up-the-perfect-codeigniter-tdd-environment/">this environment</a> but I've run into a problem with being too stupid to figure out the changes to my Apache .htaccess file to make it work (UPDATE:  Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/spooons">@spooons</a> for helping me out to get it working).</p>

<p>
So you can take your lightweight frameworks and chuck them out the window if I have to waste more than 15 minutes of my time figuring out how to write tests for it.  TDD is an essential tool when you get to the maintenance phase of a project. 
</p>

<h3>Django Applications are doing things right</h3>

<p>
If you use Django, you can find lots of third-party applications that you can literally drop into place into your existing one and start using it.  Can you imagine doing this with your favourite PHP framework?  Being ignorant, I have no idea how easy it would be to create something like <a href="http://uswaretech.com/blog/2009/08/django-socialauth-login-via-twitter-facebook-openid-yahoo-google/">Django-Socialauth</a> for Zend Framework, where you can drop it into your application and it comes with templates and models and controllers for handling all these things.   I was astounded by both the foresight that went into Django that allows people, as long as they follow specific conventions, to create standalone applications that you can use in pretty much any Django application.  As long as you haven't hacked Django itself too much.
