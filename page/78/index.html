            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2008/10/02/cakephp-12rc3-released/">CakePHP 1.2RC3 Released</a></h2>
           <h3>October 2nd, 2008</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Thanks to the power of Twitter I found out that <a href="http://live.cakephp.org">The Show for CakePHP</a> was resuscitated and brought back to life last night.  I listened to the (surprisingly short) show, the main thrust of which was that CakePHP 1.2RC3 was released last night.  Why should you care?
<ul>
<li>Final RC before a final 1.2 release</li>
<li>Significant speed increases in the wake of <a href="http://talks.php.net/show/froscon08">Rasmus Lerdorf's talk about PHP framework performace</a>, and Cake's poor showing.</li>
<li>A chance to totally break your application by upgrading!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Well, maybe not so much on the last item but it's ALWAYS good to see any project make a significant release.  1.2 has been in the works for more than 18 months, which seems to many to be way too long.  I'm not so sure I share that sentiment.  If the goal is to try and produce quality releases, then "it's done when it's done" is a reasonable answer.  I'm sure this is not a new argument, so I won't get into it here.
</p>

<p>
My own contributions to RC3 have been, what's the word...non-existent.  Non-computer hobbies + side work = no time to contribute to Cake.  I found out that commit access for people who haven't contributed anything in more than 60 days has been revoked, but that's really just a minor annoyance.  I'm sure I could get it back by asking nicely and actually having something to contribute.
</p>

<p>
But I think I've gotten back into Cake developing at the right time as I caved in and decided that my long-rumoured <a href="http://www.rallyhat.com">plan-a-road-trip site</a> shall be built in CakePHP after all.  Yes, I've been playing around with Django but I'm violating one of my favourite rules:  Just Build It, Damnit!  I've been fooling around with <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups/">Balsamiq Mockups</a> to do the pages and are now digging around for helpers to do the mapping mashup I need.  If you want to mock me over how little progress I've made, feel free to visit the site.  If you'd like to get involved at all (I could use some help on the "make a pretty UI for it" front) let me know.

For those who remember how I was an <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2008/03/18/im-an-editor-waffler/">editor waffler</a> will remember that I play around with <a href="http://community.activestate.com/products/Komodo">Komodo</a> from time to time, and decided to get back into using it again.  There are alpha 5.0 versions available so I downloaded one and tried it out.  Seems to be less resource hungry than previous versions (as in it doesn't cause my fan in  my MacBook to start up every time I open Komodo).  Now, since I know a few people at Activestate I emailed Jeff Griffiths to ask him a few questions.  He responded by hacking together something very quickly for <a href="http://community.activestate.com/node/2794">adding code intelligence for CakePHP to your views</a>.  If you're a Komodo user (or are interested in trying out Komodo), try it out and let Jeff know how it's working out.

It's time again for a round-up of the ideas that have been bouncing around in my head this past month, because I don't have enough material for a big blog post.  Not yet, any way.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh look, <a href="http://manning.com/obrien/">another CakePHP book</a> coming out that I can review if the author pulls some strings.  Yes, I'm talking to YOU AD7Six</li>
<li>Although the title of the presentation is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Fr65PFqfk">"Why I Hate Django"</a>, Cal Henderson from Flickr shows why you simply cannot avoid frameworks when building applications.  Deny this fact at your own peril.</li>
<li>If you're not already reading their blog, check out Felix and Tim (and sometimes Nate) over at the <a href="http://debuggable.com/">Debuggable Ltd.</a> blog where you can find some of the best CakePHP tips around.  Felix is closing on on 30 straight days of blogging, though not always CakePHP related.</li>
<li>I'm going to be in Mountain View, CA next Wednesday (the 24th) for a super-secret meeting and have some time to kill before my red-eye flight back home.  Maybe we can hook up so you can hurl abuse at me and so I can get enough alcohol in me to sleep on the red-eye flight back to Toronto?</li>
