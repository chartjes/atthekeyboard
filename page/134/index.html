            <p>Man, I never realized that I could actually learn to enjoy Javascript.  It looks just like PHP or even <em>gasp</em> Ruby code to me at times. :)</p>

<p>For my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mustique-island.com">current paid side project</a> I've been using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a> to do some cool transformational effects.  On the page that shows the details for a villa, there's a little section, sort of a sidebar, that has things like the number of rooms, price, etc.  Visitors are then allowed to share the information by sending an email.</p>

<p>So, being a guy who always wants to learn I said "Hell, lemme whip up some Ajax goodness so that we don't have to do any page refreshes."  Then I said "How the hell do I do that with jQuery any way."  Long story short,  I got it to work.  I'm finally getting the hang of this stuff.  How easy was it?  Lemme show you:</p>

<p>First, I put all the different divs that will be displayed into the main page. Perhaps this is sloppy, but I'm just a beginner at this.  I then went to the style sheet for that particular page and added in:</p>

<pre><code>#email {
    display: none;
}

#email_thankyou {
    display: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That made sure those two divs wouldn't show up until I turned them on.? Then, I created an href of the style <a xhref="javascript: foo();"> in a successful effort to avoid having the page scroll up to the top when they click on the link.? Then, we added in the following jQuery magic:</p>

<pre><code><br />function shareVilla() {

$("#details").hide("fast");

$("#email").fadeIn("slow"));

}

</code></pre>

<p>Man, I love helper functions that actually read like English.</p>

<p>So then I made sure to hack an existing form validation script to then use some Ajax and post the data to an external PHP script that will send the email.? Here's what I added in, again in jQuery style:</p>

<pre><code><br />$.post("foo.php",
{ send_to: document.res_form.send_to.value,
email: document.res_form.email.value,
from: document.res_form.from.value,
your_email_address: document.res_form.your_email_address.value,
textarea: document.res_form.textarea.value,
villa_description: document.res_form.villa_description.value,
villa_url: document.res_form.villa_url.value},
function(){
$("#email").hide("fast");
$("#email_thanks").fadeIn("slow");
});

</code></pre>

<p>Again, I find that code to be very readable which means I can actually go back to it later and figure out what it was doing. So, it works:? content fades in and out, data gets posted to an external script, so all that's left is to test to make sure that the emails actually do get sent out.</p>

<p>A tip of my hat to John Resig for creating a great, compact Javascript library.? Steal from the best, I always say.</a></p>

            <p>My latest magazine article for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect magazine</a> entitled "Learning from Ruby on Rails" was published today.  You can think of it as a companion to my talk I gave at php|works back in September.  One thing I will have to do is see how much of the article was edited.  I worried that I rambled and that it would deviate too much from my talk.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I encourage you to read it and send me your feedback.</p>

            <p>Well, the first version of the catfish didn't go well.? Lots of errors in IE and other flakiness.? Back to the drawing board and now we have a second version that shows some promise.? I went back to basics, grabbing the example from SitePoint because I was having a brain-disconnect on the other example that was using the Prototype library.</p>

<p>Instead, I seized another opportunity to learn something and decided to use <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a>, a really cool lightweight Javascript library (based on moofx I think).? Right now I'm using it to do a nice fade-in for the graphic but we can expand it to cover other things depending on the demands of the site.</p>

<p>I'll also being using jQuery for a <a href="http://www.mustique-island.com">really cool consulting job I'm doing</a> that requires some Ajaxian goodness.</p>
