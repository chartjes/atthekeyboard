            <p>Reworking the <a href="http://www.ibl.org">website for my simulation baseball league</a> has brought forth my wanna-do-something side.  The website is looking good, and the next step is to get the theme that I want working properly and implement that stats-on-demand module that I've been promising.</p>

<p>However, I've also wanted to do something that I could share with other people.  In this case, I've decided to start an open source project.  My favourite programmer girl <a href="http://slash7.com">Amy Hoy</a> recently went through a site meltdown thanks to a scriptac.ulo.us cheatsheet getting <a href="http://digg.com">dugg</a>.  In that article she said that she wished she had a Rails-based weblog tracking application to use.  Some further discussions via IM with Amy convinced me that this is something I could do.</p>

<p>At my previous employer I did write a bunch of website-tracking code.  It was not very efficient in it's first incarnation but by the time I got around to getting the okay for a rewrite, they replaced it with something else that they paid a TON of money for.  Ah well.  Being older and wiser (and more experienced with such things) I know how I'd do this using Rails, so we'll see if I can put my money where my mouth is.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I've set up a small page for <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/r00bstat">r00bstat</a> just to get it out there.  I've already been working on the plugin part with some testing coming up in the near future (unit tests to be included!), but the accompanying Rails appication to display the data is the daunting part of the task.  I have a few ideas...and being able to develop on my laptop on the train is good way to try these things out.</p>

<p>Thanks to my friend <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> for helping me to come up with a suitable Web 2.0 name for the project. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" /></p>

            <p>At my <a href="http://www.verticalscope.com">current job</a> we also run a website for information about web hosting called <a href="http://www.tophosts.com">TopHosts</a>.  I did most of the form submission code in the background and integrated <a href="http://htdig.org">ht://Dig</a> with the articles that are up there.  I was asked to contribute a short article on PHP.  So I quickly whipped up <a href="http://www.tophosts.com/articles/002974.html">this article</a>.</p>

<p>Just a quick intro for people who don't know much about PHP.  They've asked me to contribute other articles down the road on the topic of PHP, mainly because the editor of the site liked my article in <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a> magazine.</p>

            <p>If you program on a Mac, maybe you've used &lt;a href="//www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/"">SubEthaEdit from CodingMonkeys</a>.  It's a cool text editing tool that lets you do collaborative editing.  I tried it once with some of my buddies and the three of us we hacked out some code all at the same time.  Really cool stuff.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="//maczot.com/"">BLOGZOT 2.0 on MacZOT.com</a> has decided to offer SubEthaEdit at a reduced cost.  <a href="//www.codingmonkeys.de/blog/articles/2006/04/25/maczot-blogzot-subethaedit-bargain-maybe-even-for-free-today"">Every person who blogs about it helps drive the price down</a>.  This means that MacZOT and TheCodingMonkeys will award $105,000 in Mac software if the price goes all the way down to zero. SubEthaEdit does syntax highlighting for all the major languages, and integrates with an FTP client of your choice to save your work on a remote server.</p>

<p>Blog about this and we can get a copy FOR FREE!.  Spread the wurd.</p>
