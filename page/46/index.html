           <h3>March 19th, 2010</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.html">Zend_Form</a> is a super-powerful, force-of-nature tool.  By force-of-nature I mean it does all this crazy stuff, and you can see it doing it, but I am not alone in admitting that taming it sometimes is very difficult.  When building tools to make form programatically you either severely limit peoples options or make it so flexible that there are multiple ways to get something done.  Given the concept that Zend Framework "treats you like an adult" (I cannot find the blog post where I read this) it is not surprising that Zend_Form takes the flexible route.
</p>

<p>
Before I go any further, thanks (again) to <a href="http://twitter.com/elazar">@elazar</a> and to <a href="http://akrabat.com/">Rob Allen</a> aka <a href="http://twitter.com/akrabat">@akrabat</a> for helping me solve this particular problem.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so onto my problem.  I was creating a page for a fantasy baseball draft application to process transaction requests.  You could do one thing, and one thing only:  make a request to add a free agent to your team and what player off your team you wanted to drop.  Since I needed to locate form elements in specific places in the layout, I didn't do the usual < ?= $form ?> in my template, instead I created a bunch of setX methods, with X representing a specific form element.  Then, in my templates I simply did < ?= $form->X ?> where X represents the specific element.  Let me show you what I mean:
</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;form action="/baseball/&lt;?= $this-&gt;league ?&gt;/transactions/process" method="post"&gt;
                &lt; ?= $this-&gt;transactionForm-&gt;teamId ?&gt;
                &lt; ?= $this-&gt;transactionForm-&gt;shortLeagueName ?&gt;
                &lt;table width="100%"&gt;
                    &lt;tr&gt;
                        &lt;th width="50%" align="center"&gt;Players on your Team&lt;/th&gt;
                        &lt;th width="50%" align="center"&gt;Players Available&lt;/th&gt;
                    &lt;/tr&gt;
                    &lt;tr&gt;
                        &lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;
                            &lt; ?= $this-&gt;transactionForm-&gt;players ?&gt;
                        &lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;
                            &lt;div id="freeAgentList"&gt;
                                &lt; ?= $this-&gt;transactionForm-&gt;freeAgents ?&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;/table&gt;
                &lt;input type="submit" id="transactionFormSubmit" value="Request Selection"/&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
I did this figuring it would give me lots of flexibility.  Then, the pain started.
</p>

<p>
I kept wondering why every time I validated the form, it kept coming back as true.  I had a requirement that to have a successful transaction request, they had to select both a player to drop from their own team AND a free agent to add.  I had put into the form validation that a free agent was required, but it never seemed to be triggered.  Off to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> I went to ask for help, along with pleas for help on Twitter.  I had thought I was doing something subtly wrong, and I was right.
</p>

<p>
Here's the finished, working code.  I will explain what I had been doing wrong.  By the way, if you can think of a better way to do something of the more "hackish" stuff in there, I'd appreciate it.
</p>

    public function indexAction()
    {
        $form = new Baseball_Form_Transactions();
        $options = array(
            'teamId' => $this->teamId,
            'position' => 'C',
            'leagueShortName' => $this->league,
            'status' => 0
        );

        $form->setMyPlayers($options);
        $form->setFreeAgents($options);
        $form->setTeamId($options);
        $form->setShortLeagueName($options);

        if ($this->getRequest()->isPost()) {
            // This is hack to make sure we pull back the list of free agents for
            // the player's position
            $postData = $this->_request->getPost();
            $player = Doctrine::getTable('Player')->find($postData['players']);
            $options['position'] = $player['position'];
            $form->setFreeAgents($options);

            if ($form->isValid($this->_request->getPost())) {
                $data = $form->getValues();
                $leagueInfo = Doctrine::getTable('League')->findOneByShortName($data['shortLeagueName'])->toArray();

                // Create the request top drop an existing player       
                $transactionInfo = array(
                    'league_id' => $leagueInfo['id'],
                    'team_id' => $data['teamId'],
                    'player_id' => $data['players'],
                    'type' => 'drop',
                    'target_team_id' => 0,
                    'transaction_date' => date('Y-m-d H:m:s'),
                    'shortLeagueName' => $data['shortLeagueName'],
                    'group_id' => uniqid()
                );
                $transaction = new Transaction();
                $transaction->fromArray($transactionInfo);
                $transaction->save();

                // Now we do the request to add a player
                $transactionInfo['team_id'] = 0;
                $transactionInfo['player_id'] = $data['freeAgents'];
                $transactionInfo['target_team_id'] = $data['teamId'];
                $transactionInfo['type'] = 'add';
                $transaction = new Transaction();
                $transaction->fromArray($transactionInfo);
                $transaction->save();
                $this->_flashMessenger->addMessage('Added transaction');
            }
        }

        $this->view->transactionForm = $form;
        $this->view->messages = $this->_flashMessenger->getMessages();
        $transaction = new Transaction();
        $this->view->transactions = $transaction->byTeam($options);
    }

</p>

<p>The big mistake?  I was not setting up all the form elements via my setX calls BEFORE I did the validation.  Because I didn't, those elements didn't exist, and therefore the validation never got called.  See, I told you my mistake was (a) dumb and (b) subtle.
</p>

<p>
I think I did the right thing with my method of creating the form elements outside of the init() method to give me the ability to layout things where I wanted them.  I'm interested in finding out how other people have solved the same problem.

           <h3>March 16th, 2010</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Out of the ashes of a severe personality clash in an <a href="http://cakephp.org">open source PHP web application framework project</a> rose a new framework proclaiming that it <a href="http://rad-dev.org/lithium/wiki">simply sucks less than all the others</a>.  Lithium, otherwise known as li3, is the latest PHP application framework to come onto the scene.  I know what you're saying.  *Yawn*.
</p>

<p>
As far as I can tell, Lithium is trying it's hardest to be fast, lightweight, and use all the features that PHP 5.3 has to offer.  I am unable to use it at work for a variety of reasons (not stable, required PHP 5.3 only, <a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele">Nate</a> is always picking on me via IM) but I am more interested in the ideas that are coming out of it.
</p>

<p>
It is using all the newest hawtness in the PHP world:  namespaces, closures, Phar, late static binding.  I could go on, but probably most of these things mean nothing to you until you actually need them.  In the framework world, namespaces are a big deal, an essential tool to avoiding collisions with 3rd party code you might want to integrate into your project.  Closures are very familiar to those who've done work with Ruby or Javascript.  Phar allows for some unarchiving on the fly of code, even potentially distributing your application as an archive that can be run.  Late static binding is something I'm trying to comes to grips with, as I have either never come across a need for it or never realized that I did and have implemented a workaround for it not realizing there is a simpler solution.
</p>

<p>
None of these are what I want to talk about.  I want to talk about something that I feel is a very underrated part of Lithium, the ability to define filters.  This is a concept that you find in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">Aspect-oriented programming</a>, and one that I imagine most programmers have never considered.  Here's why I think it's a big deal.
</p>

<p>
Most frameworks are designed around an OOP paradigm.  Yes, some mix them together (I'm looking at *you* CodeIgniter), but by and large you get the job done by extending on a base model / controller / helper / whatever to create new functionality.  Sometimes this is not avoidable.  But what AOP says is that there is another way, a way that Lithium has adopted as well.
</p>

<p>
Hence the creation of "filters".  As far as I can tell (and I'm sure I will be jumped upon if I am wrong) the purpose of filters in Lithium is to allow you to add functionality without extending the class itself.  When I saw that I immediately understood why that is so awesome.
</p>

<p>
The idea of callbacks is also very similar:  if X happens, run code Y.  A staple of jQuery, Rails and probably other projects I have forgotten to mention.  The idea is still the same though.  In Garrett Woodworth's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gwoo/li3-ocphp">presentation about Lithium to the Orange County PHP Users Group</a> he goes  over some solid examples of filters including:
<ul>
<li>automatic use of the <a href="http://mirror.facebook.net/facebook/xhprof/doc.html">XHProf</a> for code profiling</li>
<li>automatic setting of parameters upon saving a pasted bit of code</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>It's also been used to <a href="http://misja.posterous.com/playing-with-lithium">automatically change string record ID's into a MongoDB ID</a> and <a href="http://latestatic.com/integration-testing-or-how-i-learned-to-stop">graceful failing of an integration test suite when an error occurs</a>.
</p>

<p>
These filters remind me of behaviors in Rails (and in CakePHP as well) and makes me wonder if signals are the same thing in the Django world.  All in all, this looks to me to be a better way to extend functionality than actually overriding existing methods or hacking at something deep inside a class.  Figure out what functionality you want, figure out where it needs to be called, and add your filter.

            <p>
Some of my long-time readers have seen me mention a long-festering (I believe that is the correct term at this point) project that I dubbed <a href="http://www.rallyhat.com">Rallyhat</a>.  It first started out as a "figure out when some baseball teams are in town and buy tickets" and then morphed into "a tool for helping people plan road trips by tagging destinations with information".
</p>

<p>
What it really became was a tool for me to learn how to write a solid web-app using Python and Django.  I'm happy to say I finally have a version that I feel comfortable sharing with the rest of you.  So feel free to check it out.  Pound on it, try and break it and I will also read your feedback and comments.  I'm sure you can figure out my email address...
</p>

<p>
Also, I've found it has been easy to pick up not only Python and Django itself.  I'm ready to tackle some other applications using Django, and I have one just in mind.  
</p>

<p>
Yes, I am aware at how spartan it looks right now.  I'm more focussed on functionality than how it looks right now.  I've already gotten some interesting ideas on expanding the app to include adding in images to go with locations, so we'll see how that goes.
</p>

<p>
For those who are curious, I built it using the following:
<ul>
<li>Python 2.6</li>
<li>Django 1.2 beta 1</li>
<li><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> to store the trip plans</li>

<li><a href="http://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar">Django Debug Toolbar</a></li>
<li>deployed using Nginx + <a href="http://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn">Gunicorn</a>, configured with the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/ericlo">Eric Florenzano's</a> awesome Django Advent article about <a href="http://djangoadvent.com/1.2/deploying-django-site-using-fastcgi/">deploying Django using FastCGI</a> because it mentioned how you could use Gunicorn</li>
