            <p>
The other day I had a nice meeting in my basement lair with my co-workers.  We laughed.  We cried.  We had some BBQ'd burgers, and nobody got food poisoning.  As we discussed the implementation of our new fantasy gaming platform, I managed to figure out that one requirement was for an admin to upload a header and footer file for a game.  "The idea here is to be able to set up a new game for someone without programmer intervention". </p>

<p>
After I got over being insulted that a programmer was not required for every tiny tweak to the site (I'm kidding) I tried to figure out how I was going to accomplish this.  I'm not a big fan of storing actual HTML content in a database.  Call me old-fashioned, but I feel my HTML content belongs on the filesystem, and nowhere else.  Besides, it makes it harder to do deployments of code on multiple servers if all the templates aren't there to begin with.
</p>

<p>
The solution was, of course, obvious:  create a custom Zend_View and override stuff until you get it behaving the way you want!  The logic for doing this is actually quite simple:
<ol>
<li>Check to see if the script in question exists in the file system</li>
<li>If not, figure out what template we need to pull from the database.</li>
<li>Read in contents of that script from the database</li>
<li>Write contents to the filesystem</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>:  I am not sure if this is the most elegant solution for solving this particular problem.  I am open to a different solution so long as it meets the same needs.
</p>

<p>
Since I've made a commitment to doing TDD for this project, naturally I started out with a test:
~~~

< ?php
require_once 'PHPUnit/Framework.php';
require_once 'Zend/Application.php';

// Define path to application directory
if (!defined('APPLICATION_PATH')) {
    define('APPLICATION_PATH', realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../../application'));
}

// Define application environment
if (!defined('APPLICATION_ENV')) {
    define('APPLICATION_ENV', (getenv('APPLICATION_ENV') ? getenv('APPLICATION_ENV') : 'test'));
}

// Ensure library/ is on include_path
set_include_path(implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, array(
        realpath(APPLICATION_PATH . '/../library'),
            get_include_path(),
        )));

class Xmlteam_ZFViewTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase 
{

    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->bootstrap = new Zend_Application(
            'testing',
            APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini'
        );
        parent::setUp();
    }

    public function tearDown()
    {
        parent::tearDown();
    }

    
    public function testRenderView()
    {
        $templateData = array(
            'league_short_name' => 'testing',
            'type' => 'header',
            'created_at' => new Doctrine_Expression('NOW()'),
            'content' => '<div id="header"><b>header</b></div>'
        );
        $testTemplate = new Template();
        $testTemplate->fromArray($templateData);
        $testTemplate->save();
        $testView = new Xmlteam_ZFView(); 
        $testView->setScriptPath('./application/views');
        $content = $testView->render('testing-header.phtml');
        $this->assertTrue(file_exists('./application/views/testing-header.phtml'));
        $this->assertEquals($content, $templateData['content']);
        $testTemplate->delete();
        unlink('./application/views/testing-header.phtml');
    }   
}
~~~
For those wondering, yes all the tests pass. ;)</p>

<p>The "Template" is a Doctrine (1.2) model that represents the table where I'm storing information about the templates.  Yes, it has unit tests too.  That pass.
</p>

<p>So how do we accomplish this?  First, I hit up my peeps on Twitter and the advice from <a href="http://twitter.com./weierophinney">Matthew Weier-O'Phinney</a> himself was to simply create my own Zend_View and override what needed to be overriden.   Also, he was very wise to tell me to look at Zend/View.php itself for guidance.   That and some helpful messages from exceptions during testing.
</p>

<p>
Here's the initial implementation, for which all tests pass.
~~~
< ?php

// Custom view that reads in templates from the database and
// writes them to the filesystem

class Xmlteam_ZFView extends Zend_View_Abstract
{
    private $_filter = array();
    private $_file = null;

    public function __construct($config = array())
    {
        parent::__construct($config);
    }

    /**
     * Custom method to see if template is in the file system
     * and then load it into memory, write out to the file system
     * if it doesn't
     *
     * @param string $name The script name to precess
     * @return string THe script output
    */
    public function render($name)
    {
        $scriptPaths = $this->getScriptPaths();
        $filename = $scriptPaths[0] . $name;
        
        if (!file_exists($filename)) {
            list($league, $tmp) = explode('-', $name);
            list($templateType, $extension) = explode('.', $tmp);
            $q = Doctrine_Query::create()
                ->select('t.*')
                ->from('Template t')
                ->where('t.league_short_name = ?', $league)
                ->andWhere('t.type = ?', $templateType);
            $q->setHydrationMode(Doctrine_Core::HYDRATE_ARRAY);
            $results = $q->execute();

            if (count($results) > 0) {
                file_put_contents($filename, $results[0]['content']);
            }
        }
        
        // find the script file name using the parent private method
        $this->_file = $this->_script($name);
        unset($name); // remove $name from local scope

        ob_start();
        $this->_run($filename);

        return $this->_filter(ob_get_clean()); // filter output
    }

                    /**
     * Applies the filter callback to a buffer.
     *
     * @param string $buffer The buffer contents.
     * @return string The filtered buffer.
     */
    private function _filter($buffer)
    {
        // loop through each filter class
        foreach ($this->_filter as $name) {
            // load and apply the filter class
            $filter = $this->getFilter($name);
            $buffer = call_user_func(array($filter, 'filter'), $buffer);
        }

        // done!
        return $buffer;
    }

    /**
     * Includes the view script in a scope with only public $this variables.
     *
     * @param string The view script to execute.
     */
    protected function _run()
    {
        if ($this->_useViewStream && $this->useStreamWrapper()) {
            include 'zend.view://' . func_get_arg(0);
        } else {
            include func_get_arg(0);
        }
    }
}
~~~
So, what did I learn from this process?
<ol>
<li>I needed to create my own private _file and _filter variables to match what exists in  so that if I create any custom filters they can be applied to my custom view *and* to keep compatibility with existing code.</li>
<li>Because the _run method is protected AND abstract, I needed to implement my own _run method in my custom view, or else it would spit out errors.  Even if it doesn't do anything special.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>You can see that the logic in my render method is pretty much as I outlined before.  I realize I will take a slight hit the first time we go to load a particular template.  I'm assuming at some point I will want to run a test to see just how long it does take to pull in the template from the database and write it to the file system.  I'm guessing this will not be a serious performance hit, but you never know.  All those file_exists() calls can't be that good for performance,
</p>

<p>
I look forward to seeing other potential solutions to this problem

           <h3>June 16th, 2010</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>The folks at Packt Publishing asked if I was interested in reviewing their upcoming title <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/codeigniter-1-7-professional-development/book">"CodeIgniter 1.7: Professional Development"</a> due to my experience with CodeIgniter.  While it is not my favourite framework (for reasons that I have explained on this blog), I still have to work with it going forward.  I was interested to see what direction such a book would take.  After going through it, I was happily surprised.
</p>

<p>
When I read a book about a programming framework, I'm expecting to see that they start off with the basics of using the framework, then keep expanding on the abilities of the framework.  By the end of the book, you should be able to build something OTHER than the example application (if they provide one).  I mean, if I just want a list of functions then I will hit up Google/Bing/Duck Duck Go to find the info I want.  This book starts with the basics of the framework, and patiently builds on the concepts you previously learned.  Good, clear examples of how to do things.  
</p>

<p>
I thought another nice touch was the expanding into concepts like scaling the application, and extending the framework itself.  If there is one thing I've learned building web apps over the years, it's that you (a) inevitably need to worry about scaling the application and (b) you end up having to make your own modifications to the framework itself to meet unique challenges for the application.
</p>

<p>
All in all, I recommend this book to anyone who is planning on using CodeIgniter 1.7 (and beyond) to build web apps.  The sections on the first steps towards scaling your app, and extending CodeIgniter itself make this book stand out from the crowd.

            <h2><a href="/2010/06/03/testing-controllers-hiding-behind-zend_auth/">Testing Controllers Hiding Behind Zend_Auth</a></h2>
           <h3>June 3rd, 2010</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>(Note, this example was using Zend Framework 1.10, so things might change going forwards).</p>

<p>As a lapsed tester, I've made the commitment to build out our Zend Framework powered application using tests going forward.  The first two modules for the app *should* have been done with tests, and for that I hang my head with shame.  Now that I've invested the work in creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a> environment using <a href="http://hudson-ci.org">Hudson</a>, there is no longer an excuse to not write tests.  Especially when I can get tests run automatically every time I commit code.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I was asked to implement a new feature for the application:  a list of all transactions for a fantasy baseball league, sorted by date.  What a perfect excuse to write some tests!  The initial problem though was how do I simulate logging in a user so I can see this page, which was protected by authentication using Zend_Auth.  So I started my scouring the internet for answers.
</p>

<p>
I found quite a few examples on how to test a controller, using the $this->dispatch('/path/to/action') method but found that I wasn't getting redirected properly to the post-login page.  I was passing proper credentials in and everything.  Then finally after deciding to go back to basics and read up on just how to test Zend_Auth.  After some swearing a few face-palms, I realized what I had been doing wrong.
</p>

<p>
The tl;dr version:  I was forgetting that the unit test itself needed to manually log in the user by speaking with Zend_Auth directly.  Here's the testing code for that particular controller:
~~~
< ?php

require_once 'Zend/Test/PHPUnit/ControllerTestCase.php';
require_once 'Zend/Application.php';

// Define path to application directory
if (!defined('APPLICATION_PATH')) {
    define('APPLICATION_PATH', realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../../application'));
}

// Define application environment
if (!defined('APPLICATION_ENV')) {
    define('APPLICATION_ENV', (getenv('APPLICATION_ENV') ? getenv('APPLICATION_ENV') : 'test'));
}

// Ensure library/ is on include_path
set_include_path(implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, array(
        realpath(APPLICATION_PATH . '/../library'),
            get_include_path(),
        )));

class TransactionControllerTest extends Zend_Test_PHPUnit_ControllerTestCase 
{

    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->bootstrap = new Zend_Application(
            'testing',
            APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini'
        );
        parent::setUp();
    }

    public function loginUser($login, $passwd, $shortLeague)
    {
        $authParams = array(
            'login' => $login,
            'password' => $passwd,
            'short_league' => $shortLeague 
        );
        $adapter = new Xmlteam_Auth($authParams);
        $auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance();
        $result = $auth->authenticate($adapter);
        $this->assertTrue($auth->hasIdentity());
    }

    public function tearDown()
    {
        parent::tearDown();
    }

    public function testOverallBaseballList()
    {
        $this->loginUser('test@test.com', '*****', 'bluejays2010');
        $this->dispatch('/baseball/bluejays2010/transactions/list');
        $this->assertModule('baseball', 'In baseball module');
        $this->assertController('transactions', 'In the transactions controller');
        $this->assertQuery('#tblTransactions', 'Transaction table exists');
    }
}
~~~
</p>

<p>
I'm using a custom authentication adaptor with Zend_Auth, as we need to limit access for a user to a particular league.  Perhaps better to do it with Zend_Acl, and since the platform is likely to expand I will end up using that as well.  But I am drifting off topic here.
</p>

<p>
The magic is in that loginUser() method.  What I did not realize at the time was that running a test where I asked it to dispatch users to the login page and passed along what would've been entered in the form was not working.  Perhaps it was creating an authenticated session OUTSIDE the scope of the test environment.  Perhaps it is my sucky code.  Either way, it wasn't working.
</p>

<p>
So, by creating a authenticated login Zend_Auth *inside* the test, I could then safely dispatch my testing code to look at pages requiring authentication.  I hope this blog posts helps out others trying to write tests for controllers that are hidden behind Zend_Auth.
