        </header>
        <div>
            <p>One of the things that I have learned to quickly appreciate about working at
<a href="http://kaplanprofessional.com">Kaplan Professional</a> is the very large suite
of unit and integration tests. I believe there are 2000+ tests, and although
there has been a dip in code coverage, it is still impressive to see coverage
levels for most things in the 65%+ range. We'll get it back up to where it
belongs in no time.</p>

<p>With such an extensive array of tests, I have received an education in what
it really means to write unit tests for live, production-ready code that really
takes unit testing seriously. I think that the biggest problem that most
developers face when getting into Test Driven Development is not understanding
of how to efficiently use mock objects.</p>

<p>If you are really writing your unit tests the way you should, each test is
focusing on testing one bit of functionality in isolation, which means that
you will be heavily relying on mock objects to make things work. I've come
up with an example scenario that I hope goes a long way to explaining how
to effectively use mock objects.</p>

<p>In these examples I am using PHPUnit's <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.0/en/mock-objects.html">built-in support</a>
for mock objects. At Kaplan our testing engineer told me that he had tried to use
<a href="https://github.com/padraic/mockery">Mockery</a> but there were problems getting
it to play nicely with the dependency injection container that is in use (it's
a customized version of <a href="http://pimple.sensiolabs.org">Pimple</a>). Can't argue
with that. Not until I experiment with Mockery myself to see if it gains us
anything instead of using what comes with PHPUnit.</p>

<p>So here is our scenario: we have a class called Alpha, that contains a method
called munge(). We wish to test that method in a unit test. So what does
this class look like?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

class Alpha
{
    // Omit code showing constructor...

    public function munge(Foo $foo, Bar $bar)
    {
        $fooDetails = $foo-&gt;getDetails();
        $fooId = $foo-&gt;getId();

        $barStartDate = $bar-&gt;getStartDate();
        $barEndDate = $bar-&gt;getEndDate();

        $source = "{$fooId}|{$fooDetails}|{$barStartDate}|{$barEndDate}";

        return md5('rocksalt' . $source);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My grumpy tester's eye looks at that and immediately says "we will need to 
mock those Foo and Bar objects to make this test work." First we need to look
at the Foo object</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class Foo 
{
    // Omit code showing how we construct a Foo object

    public function getId()
    {
        return $this-&gt;_id;
    }

    public function getDetails()
    {
        $tree = $this-&gt;_tree;
        $branch = $this-&gt;_branch;

        return $tree . '-&gt;' . $branch;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like this class represents one "Foo" object in the system. I omitted
the constructor as it's not really important to the lesson I'm trying to teach
here. Let's assume we have a way to generate a Foo object via some sort of
mapper.</p>

<p>Our Alpha->munge() method expects to be passed in a Foo object and to retrieve
info via getDetails() and getId() calls. Let's start our test and mock that up.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class Test extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{

    public function testAlphaMunge()
    {
        $mockFoo = $this-&gt;getMockBuilder('Foo')
            -&gt;disableOriginalConstructor()
            -&gt;getMock();
        $mockFoo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;atLeastOnce())
            -&gt;method('getDetails')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue('1-&gt;2'));
        $mockFoo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;atLeastOnce())
            -&gt;method('getId')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue('1'));

        // More test fun to come
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you build a mock for use in your test, you generally have to do two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a mock of the object itself</li>
<li>tell it what to do when specific methods are called</li>
</ul>

<p>What I've done here is pretty standard EXCEPT for the use of that disableOriginalConstructor()
method. Why is it used? Well, sometimes when you are creating a mock of an object
it will often have a constructor that accepts parameters. I'm not testing to see
if we can create the object, I merely am trying to simulate some of the methods
of that object.</p>

<p>Once I've created the mock of the object, I then tell it what
to do when I make certain method calls. Clearly I've just pulled some 
arbitrary values out of my ass for this example, but usually you can figure
out what some reasonable return values are supposed to be by, you know, actually
looking at the code you are mocking.</p>

<p>So what does our Bar object look like?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class Bar
{
    // Same drill, no need to show constructor details

    public function getStartDate()
    {
        return $this-&gt;_startDate;
    }

    public function getEndDate()
    {
        return $this-&gt;_endDate;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Time to add a mock Bar to our test</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class Test extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    public function testAlphaMunge()
    {
        $mockFoo = $this-&gt;getMockBuilder('Foo')
            -&gt;disableOriginalConstructor()
            -&gt;getMock();
        $mockFoo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;atLeastOnce())
            -&gt;method('getDetails')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue('1-&gt;2'));
        $mockFoo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;atLeastOnce())
            -&gt;method('getId')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue('1'));

        $mockBar = $this-&gt;getMockBuilder('Bar')
            -&gt;disableOriginalConstructor()
            -&gt;getMock();
        $mockBar-&gt;expects($this-&gt;atLeastOnce())
            -&gt;method('getStartDate')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue('2012-03-27'));
        $mockBar-&gt;expects($this-&gt;atLeastOnce())
            -&gt;method('getEndDate')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue('2012-04-09'));

        // More test fun to come
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A quick note about $this->atLeastOnce(): when you mock the objects you can tell it
how often you expect that method to be called. I had a long discussion about this
with our testing engineer Will Parker after I posted the orginal version of this post.</p>

<p>We have multiple options</p>

<ul>
<li>$this->once() - should be used only when you REALLY want that method to be called once</li>
<li>$this->atLeastOnce() - should be used when you need to do it once but aren't sure how many times</li>
<li>$this->any() - you really don't care how many times it's called</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're lazy, you'll go with $this->any() so you don't have to worry about it.
After a discussion with Will, I have come to like the use of $this->atLeastOnce().
It's not a deal-breaker no matter which one you choose, a lot of it comes down
to personal preferences.</p>

<p>So now we have our two objects mocked. Now we can go back to our test and
add in the creation of our Alpha class, inject the two mocks into the 
method we are testing, and check for expected results.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class Test extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    public function testAlphaMunge()
    {
        $mockFoo = $this-&gt;getMockBuilder('Foo')
            -&gt;disableOriginalConstructor()
            -&gt;getMock();
        $mockFoo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;atLeastOnce())
            -&gt;method('getDetails')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue('1-&gt;2'));
        $mockFoo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;atLeastOnce())
            -&gt;method('getId')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue('1'));

        $mockBar = $this-&gt;getMockBuilder('Bar')
            -&gt;disableOriginalConstructor()
            -&gt;getMock();
        $mockBar-&gt;expects($this-&gt;atLeastOnce())
            -&gt;method('getStartDate')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue('2012-03-27'));
        $mockBar-&gt;expects($this-&gt;atLeastOnce())
            -&gt;method('getEndDate')
            -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue('2012-04-09'));

        $source = "1|1-&gt;2|2012-03-27|2012-04-09";
        $expectedMunge = md5('rocksalt' . $source);

        $testAlpha = new Alpha();
        $munge = $testAlpha-&gt;getMunge($mockFoo, $mockBar);

        $this-&gt;assertEquals(
            $expectedMunge,
            $munge,
            'Munge value should match expected'
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And there you have it! A test for a specific method that uses mocks to properly
isolate functionality that is required for the test to work.</p>

<p>I hope this blog post makes things a lot clearer when it comes to understanding
the role of mocks when creating unit tests.</p>

           <h3>March 9th, 2012</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>After 13 months I've decided to move on from <a href="http://moontoast.com">Moontoast</a>
and take a position as a senior web developer with <a href="http://kaplanprofessional.com/">Kaplan Professional</a>
working on their platform team and trying to create all sorts of testable
awesomeness with them. I start on March 12 with two weeks of training in
La Crosse, WI, followed by two weeks at home (wanted to be home for my birthday
and family good times as Easter), followed by 4 weeks in La Crosse and then
back in my basement lair cranking out the work.</p>

<p>With the new position comes more of the stuff I am really passionate about: 
testing and automation. Which also got me to thinking about the reasons why I
am so passionate about these things.</p>

<p>I thought I would create my own little testing mini-manifesto here. The ideas
my <a href="http://devhell.info">podcasting</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/funkatron"> partner</a> did with his <a href="http://microphp.org">MicroPHP Manifesto</a>
made me realize that sometimes it is good to write these things down, as it
were.</p>

<h2 id="i-test-because-the-tools-are-easy-to-use">I test because the tools are easy to use</h2>

<p>I write tests because the tools that exist today to write them are easy to
install and testing techniques are easily taught.</p>

<h2 id="i-test-because-i-don%27t-like-surprises">I test because I don't like surprises</h2>

<p>I write tests to make sure what I am building behaves the way I am expecting.</p>

<h2 id="i-test-because-i-want-people-to-understand-what-i%27ve-done">I test because I want people to understand what I've done</h2>

<p>I write tests so they can act as documentation for how to use things that I
have built.</p>

<h2 id="i-test-because-i-want-to-be-able-to-change-things-fearlessly">I test because I want to be able to change things fearlessly</h2>

<p>I write tests so that I can experiment and change things, knowing I have a 
way of telling myself if I've done something wrong.</p>

<h2 id="i-test-because-automation-is-a-secret-weapon">I test because automation is a secret weapon</h2>

<p>I write tests so I can create an automated developer workflows
that will reduce the likelihood that something horribly broken makes it
into production.</p>

<h2 id="i-test-because-it-forces-me-to-focus-on-design">I test because it forces me to focus on design</h2>

<p>I write tests to force me to loosely couple my components and create simple
systems that can display complex behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="i-test-because-to-me-it-is-the-right-thing-to-do">I test because to me it is the right thing to do</h2>

<p>I write tests because applications with a high level of test code coverage
have significantly reduced bug-fix cycles and turn production deployments
into non-events that happen multiple times a day.</p>

<p>I hope my mini-manifesto at least makes you think about where testing fits into
modern web application development.</p>

            <h2><a href="/2012/02/26/simple-api-testing-with-behat/">Simple API testing using Behat</a></h2>
           <h3>February 26th, 2012</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I've recently started using <a href="http://behat.org">Behat</a> as my testing framework
of choice. Why? I like the idea of writing tests in a format that is as close
to English as I can get. This also makes it easier for non-technical people
to write tests for you as well, making sure they "have some skin in the game"
as you build out your automated test suite.</p>

<p>I have been trying to push my JavaScript skills lately by first playing around
with Node.js to get a feel for event-driven server-side coding and by trying
to build something semi-useful using <a href="http://knockout.js">Knockout</a>. Knockout
is a client-side Model-View-View-Model framework that promotes four really
good principles: declarative bindings, automatic UI refreshing, dependency
tracking and templating. Check out the documentation on the Knockout web site
for a great explanation of why those are good thigns.</p>

<p>A typical Knockout-out powered site is one where the client-side code talks
to a server-side API. My experimental site for this is one that uses an 
API written in PHP using <a href="http://slimframework.com">Slim</a>. Of course, I cannot
do this without writing some tests. My first set of tests are for the calling
of the API itself.</p>

<p>After working with PHPUnit's "assert that the result matches expectations" 
philosophy, switching to using a behavioural approach has changed how I decide
to approach actually testing something. Let me show you what I mean.</p>

<p>Here's a test for an API call to get our "current" set of transactions, which
is hard-coded in the system to be all trades that have occurred in the past
3 weeks.</p>

<pre><code>Feature: transactions API 

Scenario: 
    Given I call "/transactions/current"
    Then I get a response
    And the response is JSON
    And the response contains at least one transaction
    And the first transaction contains a transaction ID
    And the first transaction contains two teams
    And the first transaction contains a description
</code></pre>

<p>If you read that out loud it sounds like how you would describe to a co-worker
what you were expecting to happen on an API call, albeit a little more stilted
and formalized.</p>

<p>When you first write a feature like this and then ask Behat to run all the
tests on it, if there is no code to execute a specific step it will give you
the skeleton of code to make it happen. Then it is up to you to implement
the actual code that will make the tests run.</p>

<p>Here's the final product:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Notice how Behat uses annotations that describe what type of scenario the
method uses. It also uses regular expressions to extract specific values
that you are wishing to test. Those are typically values inside quotes
in the actual features.</p>

<p>If you are wondering what the skeletons (or stubbs depending on what
terminology you like to use) looked like <em>before</em> I wrote code to implement
them, you can simply cut-and-paste the scenario file at the top of this
post into a feature file (don't forget to give a .feature extension) and it
will show you all of them.</p>

<p>I liked this method because it meant I could easily add more tests and
Behat would tell me what code woudl be needed to run it.</p>

<p>So what does the output look like for the test?</p>

    Given I call "/transactions/current"                # FeatureContext::iCall()
    Then I get a response                               # FeatureContext::iGetAResponse()
    And the response is JSON                            # FeatureContext::theResponseIsJson()
    And the response contains at least one transaction  # FeatureContext::theResponseContainsAtLeastOneTransaction()
    And the first transaction contains a transaction ID # FeatureContext::theFirstTransactionContainsATransactionId()
    And the first transaction contains two teams        # FeatureContext::theFirstTransactionContainsTwoTeams()
    And the first transaction contains a description    # FeatureContext::theFirstTransactionContainsADescription()

<p>I have obviously only scratched the surface of what can be done with Behat.
I myself have questions about how to prevent the FeatureContext.php file, 
which contains all the functionality that drives the tests, from getting
too large. I can also see the lure of endlessly tweaking the scenarios to
reduce the amount of code required to run them all.</p>

<p>What about code-coverage reports? Easily available in PHPUnit but is it
possible using Behat? It's still early days for some of the alternatives to
PHPUnit.</p>

<p>The example above is only the first of numerous tests that will be written
for this side project, as it needs to cover displaying archived transactions
to be voted on, user authentication, and the voting process itself.</p>

<p>I think that the BDD approach maps better to a results-oriented methodology
when it comes to testing: you are using real-life scenarios to make sure that
you are getting back the results you are expecting. In the end. that is still
the goal of testing.</p>
