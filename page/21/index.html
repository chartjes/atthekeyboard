           <h3>July 13th, 2012</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>My co-worker <a href="http://jtreminio.com">Juan Treminio</a> brought to my attention this interesting
blog post by someone advocating <a href="http://antecedent.github.com/a-time-and-place-for-monkey-patching.html">monkey-patching strtotime in order to test his code</a>.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with the term, first I suggest you go read what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">Wikipedia says about it</a>
and then try and understand why it is, in 99.999% of cases, a practice best left to 
real experts at dynamic languages that allow redefinition of methods at run time.
And definitely a terrible practice to recommend for testing purposes.</p>

<p>The use of monkey-patching is extremely prevalent in the Ruby community and
also to a certain extent in Python usage. I'm not going to go into length
about their use of it except to say that it seems quite common and I think
most developers are using it as a shortcut to counter what might be poor
code architecture decisions. Perhaps some Rubyists could provide me with
some good examples of why it is so popular amongst them. I don't hate
Ruby, let's be extremely clear about that.</p>

<p>So, our blog post author submits some code that needs testing:</p>

<pre><code>function deleteOldPosts()
{
    $threshold = strtotime("-1 year");
    # Fetch all posts older than $threshold from the database
    $oldPosts = Post::findAll(["timestamp" =&gt; ["&lt;" =&gt; $threshold]]);
    foreach ($oldPosts as $oldPost) {
        $oldPost-&gt;delete();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Quite correctly he points out that this code would be difficult to test...so he
then goes on to explain that using <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.runkit.php">runkit</a> to
monkey-patch strtotime and what is this I don't even...</p>

<p>I will start of by showing a subtle set of refactorings that would make this 
code testable, and then explode into a rant afterwards.</p>

<p>First, the threshold should be injected.</p>

<pre><code>function deleteOldPosts($threshold)
{
    # Fetch all posts older than $threshold from the database
    $oldPosts = Post::findAll(["timestamp" =&gt; ["&lt;" =&gt; $threshold]]);
    foreach ($oldPosts as $oldPost) {
        $oldPost-&gt;delete();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Second, you replace the static method call with an object instantiation
and a normal method call.</p>

<pre><code>function deleteOldPosts($threshold)
{
    # Fetch all posts older than $threshold from the database
    $post = new Post();
    $oldPosts = $post-&gt;findAll(["timestamp" =&gt; ["&lt;" =&gt; $threshold]]);
    foreach ($oldPosts as $oldPost) {
        $oldPost-&gt;delete();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Third, you inject your Post object into your function.</p>

<pre><code>function deleteOldPosts(Post $post, $threshold)
{
    $oldPosts = $post-&gt;findAll(["timestamp" =&gt; ["&lt;" =&gt; $threshold]]);
    foreach ($oldPosts as $oldPost) {
        $oldPost-&gt;delete();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>No runkit. No monkey-patching. No justification for doing stuff like this
instead of the correct, long, hard, difficult slog through a legacy code base
to do things the right way this time instead of compounding the problem.</p>

<p>The other day on Twitter I commented that I felt that any blogger who does
a post that contains code in ANY programming language needs to understand
a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>your code might be wrong</li>
<li>your approach might be wrong</li>
<li>people will take your advice as being canonical or idiomatic</li>
</ul>

<p>I am all for people sharing knowledge that they have gained. Hell, it's 
how I've made my entire career. But don't go advocating solutions to
problems when there are much more straight-forward solutions available.</p>

<p>The issue with that original method isn't that you need to monkey-patch
strtotime(). The issue is the coding decisions that led you to think that
monkey-patching ANYTHING was the way to do it.</p>

<p>There are no shortcuts to testing things. It's extra work during development 
to save you extra work at deployment. Unless you start off a project doing
TDD, you will have to refactor your code to make it work. Do not pretend
otherwise, and do not advocate the use of something that should only be
used in specific, well-understood circumstances as a shortcut for testing
your code without modifying it.</p>

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2012/06/20/yummy-sauce-on-my-behat/">Yummy sauce on my Behat</a></h2>
           <h3>June 20th, 2012</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>At <a href="http://www.kaplanproffessional.com">work</a> we have started creating a suite of
automated user acceptance tests, using <a href="http://behat.org">Behat</a>, <a href="http://mink.behat.org">Mink</a>
using selenium <a href="http://zombie.labnotes.org/">Zombie.js</a> and <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>
as our browser drivers.</p>

<p>I will be honest: I have been less-than-happy with Zombie.js' performance. It has a feel
of being unfinished and newer versions of it don't work correctly with the Behat + Mink
combo. Given that we already had some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing">smoke tests</a>
that use Selenium, we decided to have some of our AUAT's use Zombie and some use Selenium.
After a while, I get tired of seeing a test run just fine using Selenium but fail using
Zombie.js.</p>

<p>I have been pushing us every-so-slightly towards using VM's for doing our development. Getting
Zombie.js installed and available for running Behat tests isn't a big problem, but given how
flaky it has been for me and the proven use of Selenium for our tests that require the use
of Javascript I wanted people to be able to use Selenium even though they are using a 
Linux VM.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs</a>, a software-as-a-service product that allows you to 
use Selenium to run tests in browsers that are running on VM's in Sauce Lab's own infrastructure.
Basically, if you could use Selenium on your local machine you could do the same thing using
Sauce Labs.</p>

<p>For us, we're interested in using their Even better is that you can make it work using Behat + Mink 
and the Selenium RC1 drivers. The <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html">WebDriver</a> stuff for 
Selenium 2 does not work with the Sauce Labs On Demand service. If I've understood correctly what
the lead developer being Behat <a href="https://twitter.com/everzet">@everzet</a> said to me, Sauce Labs is
working on a Selenium 2 / Webdriver extension for use with Behat. I'm sure I'll be corrected if
I am wrong.</p>

<p>So what did we do in order to get our tests running on Sauce Labs? These instructions already
assume that you have installed Behat, Mink and any other support libraries and tools you need.
Check out <a href="http://sauceio.com/index.php/2012/01/adding-sauce-to-behat/">this blog post from Sauce Labs</a>
for details on how to get that all sorted out.</p>

<h2 id="step-1%3A-go-create-an-account-with-sauce-labs">Step 1: Go create an account with Sauce Labs</h2>

<p>I created the free one, contains plenty of testing minutes to allow you to play
with it.</p>

<p>I'll wait here while you go and do that.</p>

<h2 id="step-2%3A-go-download-sauce-connect">Step 2: Go download <a href="https://saucelabs.com/connect">Sauce Connect</a></h2>

<p>From their web site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sauce Connect securely proxies browser traffic between Sauce Labs' 
  cloud-based VMs and your local servers. Connect uses ports 443 and 80 for 
  communication with Sauce's cloud. Most companies allow this without 
  special exceptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, Sauce Connect sets things up so that when you tell Behat + 
Mink to run some tests on a Selenium browser located at 'ondemand.saucelabs.com'
that Sauce Lab's infrastructure knows how to connect with the application you're
testing. This sort of architecture is incredibly important if you are having to test
things (like we do) only exist on a VPN and have no public-facing URLs.</p>

<p>Follow the directions on the web site on how to install it, run it, and
some tips for troubleshooting. Can't say I agree with their suggested method of monitoring
and making sure it stays up (c'mon people, just use <a href="http://supervisord.org/">Supervisor</a>)
but otherwise the instructions are easy to follow.</p>

<h2 id="step-3%3A-modify-your-behat-configuration-files-to-use-sauce-labs-on-demand-service">Step 3: Modify your Behat configuration files to use Sauce Labs On Demand service</h2>

<p>Of course, your behat config file looks different, but here's how ours looked
(scrubbed to remove any sensitive info)</p>

<pre><code>default:
  paths:
    features:   %%BEHAT_CONFIG_PATH%%/features
    bootstrap:  %%BEHAT_CONFIG_PATH%%/features/bootstrap
  context:
    parameters:
      base_url: "https://cannot-tell-you.com"
      zombie:
          port: 9124
          host: localhost
          auto_server: true
          node_bin: 'node'
      selenium:
          host: ondemand.saucelabs.com
          port: 80
          browser: &gt;
            {
                "username": "chartjes",
                "access-key": "like-i-would-tell-you-bro",
                "browser": "iexplore",
                "browser-version": "8.",
                "os": "Windows 2003",
                "name": "Kaplan Behat Selenium Testing"
            }
  formatter:
    parameters:
      verbose: true
      time: true
      decorated: true
      language: 'en'
      output_styles:
          comment: ['black', 'yellow', ['bold']]
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I can tell, we can only run things under Windows 2003 but I do not
know if that is a limitation because of the free account I have. It sure would
suck to not be able to test things on Windows XP.</p>

<h2 id="step-4%3A-automate-all-the-things">Step 4: AUTOMATE ALL THE THINGS</h2>

<p>Now we can run all your Behat tests that use Selenium on Sauce Labs infrastructure.
Why is that such a big deal? Because Sauce Labs very thoughtfully records videos
of all your tests, along with screenshots and nice, easy-to-read log of your
tests.</p>

<p>I cannot emphasize how useful having this information is. Why? Because it gives
you something to look at when things go wrong, as Behat itself will give you
some very terse info when tests fail. The <a href="https://twitter.com/FreshWillisms">other test engineer</a> and
I let out a little squee when we saw all those things.</p>

<p>If you truly want to build a modern QA department, tools like Sauce Labs are
the standard to aim for. It's not enough to just run your automated tests using
Behat, you need to also be able to record things so you can go back and check
them out when things go wrong.</p>

<p>I mean, really, it's more important to know why a test failed than to know that
everything passed. Passing tests are boring, failing tests are a call to action
to find out why it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this blog post helps you get your own Behat + Mink environment
configured to use Sauce Labs.</p>

            <h2><a href="/atthekeyboard/2012/06/18/why-dont-you-trust-your-developers/">Why Don&#039;t You Trust Your Developers?</a></h2>
           <h3>June 18th, 2012</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>You went through the hard process of finding just the right people to work with
you on your awesome idea. You've picked some solid tools that your team
understands how to use and you are all excited to start cranking out the Next
Big Thing you've opted to work on.</p>

<p>So why don't you trust the developers you've hired to do the job without
supervision?</p>

<p>I've seen a trend where more and more people are claiming it is essential
for your team to be located in one spot: eating lunch together, creating things
together...and staying up until the wee hours of the morning fixing the
stupidly broken bullshit application you've released into the world together.</p>

<p>I've been coding for money since 1998. So that makes me a fucking internet 
senior citizen. Get off my lawn. I have spent roughly half that time either
working as the only developer for a company or as a remote developer on a team
I have encountered NOTHING in my career that
leads me to believe that having all your developers spending all their
time together in an office leads to any better results than a team of
distributed developers.</p>

<p>One of the alleged benefits of having your team all together in one place
is the "creativity and brainstorming" argument. You know, the one where
awesome things happen because you can turn to the person next to you and
say "you know, I just thought of something..." and BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE,
you have an awesome feature for your application.</p>

<p>For most of my career, the reality has been that developers sit there in
an open concept office with music being piped into their ears so that 
people won't distract them so they can get some fucking work done. Every
meeting, every random conversation, every interruption as their boss
decides today's the day we start working on his favourite feature is a
barrier to getting work done.</p>

<p>So why don't you trust the developers you've hired to do the job without supervision?</p>

<p>Is it the "Puritan work ethic" that accompanied early immigrants to North
America that causes this? People have decided you are not allowed to have
fun while working? Being remote means I can create an environment for
myself that allows me to be the most productive. This means music playing
without headphones...and a system that notifies me when my co-workers
need to communicate with me. It means a nice comfy lounger with cushions
that I can sit in in order to think about a tough task...with my laptop
in my, um, lap while doing so. It means that my comfort while working is more
important than your desire to have me sitting where you can keep an eye
on me.</p>

<p>Could I ever create that environment in a cubicle? Not a chance, Open offices AND cubicles 
serve as a reminder that someone is always watching, you cannot be free
to choose your work environment, and you better stop fucking around and get
that work done. To me it all says "we don't trust you."</p>

<p>So why don't you trust developers you've hired to do the job without supervision?</p>

<p>Again, I understand that people working in startups feel that the chaos
is a necessary part of the process. I happen to disagree with that sort
of philosophy because I feel even an application with minimal features should
be executed on with 100% effort. If you think you will "do it right next time"
then I don't know if I want to be around next time you try.</p>

<p>A control freak
who gives you a nice office, chair, free snacks and a playroom with
video games is still a control freak. They believe that you need to be
near them at all times during business hours in order to be trusted to
do the job they've asked you to do. All those things are an incentive
to get you in the office for however long THEY feel you need to be there.
How else can you explain it, if you are being rational and honest about it?</p>

<p>So why don't you trust your developers you've hired to do the job without
supervision?</p>

<p>I'd love to hash this out more in the comments, so let me know what you think.</p>
