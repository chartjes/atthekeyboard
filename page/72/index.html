            <p>Some of you may know that I have started writing a e-book about CakePHP.  I'm planning on publishing it myself for the low, low price of $7.  I thought I'd let people take a sneak peek at how it looks so far by publishing the first two chapters in very rough form.

<p>
As always, give me your feedback on what you see and I will try and make it the best little book on using CakePHP that I can.

            <p>Being one of the lucky few who telecommutes full time.  You can drag my cold, lifeless body into an offirce, thanks very much.  So, the big issue that you face when telecommuting is how to talk to all your fellow co-workers.  Where I work, we use our own IRC server to not only talk to each other (we're spread across three time zones) but as front-line support for our customers as well.  This actually works out quite well, so I've been thinking about what other tools are helpful for this.</p>

<p>
In terms of just talking amongst yourselves, it seems that <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com">Campfire</a> has a lot to offer.  In fact, I would consider using it at work if we weren't running our own IRC server.  Via <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/">Giles Bowkett</a> I found out about <a href="http://propaneapp.com/">Propane</a>, a desktop client for connecting to Campfire.  Really cool stuff, and it makes me wonder what other options are out there.
</p>

<p>
An oft-neglected category of communication tools is messages about what has been worked on by the developers.  Me, I can't stand having someone coming around all the time asking me when I've finished what I'm working on.  As a result I decided to be proactive and configured post-commit hooks for our company SVN repositories.  So now any of us who do coding work commits something, we all get a nice email about it.  Since I've done that, we've been a lot more proactive about testing things because, well, you can no longer hide when you've made a change. ;)
</p>

<p>
As for bug and ticket tracking, well, we've got a homebrewed system (created before I got there) that I don't really like.  However, it is not going away so if I want to make any changes I will have to make them myself.  First thing I was thinking about was adding something to the post-commit hooks that will add a comment to the thread for particular ticket indicating you checked in some code that dealt with the ticket.  A common feature in things like trac I'm sure, but one I'd like to see in our own system.
</p>

<p>
Let me know in the comments what type of tools you use at your company.

            <p>I ran across an article <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/web/PhpFrameworksComparingCakePhpAndSymfony">comparing CakePHP and Symfony</a> and found that the writer had a number of preconceived ideas about CakePHP.  These same ideas keep popping up everywhere, used by people looking to get their hate on about CakePHP.  I sent a very well-reasoned email to the writer clearing up some of those misconceptions, and (to his credit) he replied to me saying:

<blockquote>"Thanks for a brilliant email reply to my blog post about CakePHP and
symfony - and taking the time out to send it. Thanks so much for the
pointers and corrections."</blockquote>
So, in the interest of clarifying things about CakePHP I thought I would share that email, slightly rewritten for this blog posting, but the content is roughly the same.
</p>

<h3>Lack of Documentation</h3>

<p>
Man, this one will just not die.  One complaint seems to be the lack of documentation similar to what Symfony has.  I think that's totally fair in that there are very few *detailed* books out there explaining how to use Cake.  However, I feel that there is more than enough information on people's blogs on how to build things using CakePHP.  So, perhaps it requires time to search around via Google or your other favourite search engine, so I can understand how people are unable to find one unified source for this info.  I don't think you could ever have one definitive source for info about Cake, and the majority of contributors to Cake blog about it.  If I had to pick what I would call the definitive source out of the crowd, it would be <a href="http://book.cakephp.org">the CakePHP Cookbook</a>.
</p>

<h3>Scaffolding</h3>

<p>While I think scaffolding is a great idea to show off the strength of CakePHP, it is a toy and I have never used the scaffolding to build anything other than a throw-away prototype.  I use 'cake bake' to generate the "scaffolding"  for my application and then edit those files.  In fact, I'd say that 'cake bake' is the essential tool that anyone who uses CakePHP needs to start using RIGHT NOW if they are not already.
</p>

<p>It is my personal opinion that showing people the scaffolding stuff that Cake uses by default is counter-productive and a waste of time.  It just confuses them and leads to frustration, which is clearly what has happened to you here.  So if you want to use CakePHP, just don't use the scaffolding at all.</p>

<h3>Models are tied to controllers in a 1:1 relationship</h3>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.  Here's a sample of some code from a project I was working on that shows this</p>

<pre><code>class CalendarController extends AppController {
    var $name = 'Calendar';
    var $uses = array('UserClient', 'CalendarPending', 'LegalCase');

    function admin_index() {
        $results = $this-&gt;UserClient-&gt;Location-&gt;findByLocationId($this-&gt;Auth-&gt;user('location_id'));
        $pending_depositions = $this-&gt;CalendarPending-&gt;find('all', array('conditions' =&gt; array('location' =&gt; $results['Location']['name'])));
        $cases = $this-&gt;LegalCase-&gt;groupByDepositionType();

        $this-&gt;set('pending_depositions', $pending_depositions);
        $this-&gt;set('cases', $cases);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>For those keeping score at home, that's one controller interacting with 4 different models.  You can have controllers that don't have any associated models.  You can also have controllers that don't talk to any model at all by default by setting the uses array to equal null.  So the idea of  Cake only being for simple "one table = one view" is simply wrong.  Again, I'd like to find a way to get rid of this idea that you can only have one model per controller.</p>

<h3>Cake's Ajax and Javascript helpers do not support graceful degradation</h3>

<p>I don't use the Ajax helper but a quick look at the online documentation shows that this myth might actually be true.  Core contributor Mark Story has a post showing you an example<a href="http://mark-story.com/posts/view/providing-contextual-form-help-with-mootools">how to make that happen</a> in CakePHP, but it requires a little bit of work.  Maybe Symfony is the only "mainstream" framework out there that has put effort into implementing that.  Personally, I don't use the Ajax helpers in Cake as I prefer to use jQuery.</p>

<h3>Cake's HTML and Form helpers produces bad markup</h3>

<p>I don't feel that's true at all.  The form helper can produce legends and fieldsets...and those can be turned off via parameters in the calls to that particular helper.  Again, more work needs to be done to clue people in about this stuff.  The online documentation does show what all the parameters that the helpers take do, so check them out to find out exactly how to bend if to your will.</p>

<h3>Unit tests are an afterthought</h3>

<p>Definitely not true.  When you use the 'cake bake' utility to create the outlines of models and controllers it also creates the empty unit tests that go along with it as well.  Cake also has a very extensive set of unit tests for the framework itself and code coverage that is up past 85% last that I had seen.  Testing is important, and it's good to see that Symfony also has a commitment to that.
</p>

<h3>CakePHP is not an "enterprise capable framework"</h3>

<p>
Could someone please tell me what this actually means?  Cake is used by Mozilla for their Add-ons site, so I think that's about as enterprisy a use as you're going to see out there.
</p>

<p>
So, a few myths about CakePHP busted I hope.  The thing I wish to emphasize to those who are looking at Cake to make sure they look at the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org">CakePHP Cookbook</a> and the <a href="http://api.cakephp.org/">online API documentation</a> in order to fully understand how to use the various helpers.
