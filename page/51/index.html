<blockquote>I just saw your post regarding topic suggestions on your blog for Dec.

I actually have 2, but the first one might be better suited for a blog post.
So, here goes:

1. I started doing some freelance work to boost my portfolio and have been using CakePHP as my framework of choice in several cases.
I wanted to focus on TDD for the larger projects, thanks to Cake's nice tie in with SimpleTest, but found it impossible to market to clients.
The problem is that TDD causes an overhead on development time while reducing the bugs in the code. However, since bug fixes are basically included in the price, for the client it just translates to paying more for work that I would otherwise do for free anyway.
TDD makes sense for a company with full time developer(s), but those with a small budget/tight deadline or no technical understanding always translate it to an unnecessary additional cost & time.
Of course you could just add it to the development time and/or costs without mentioning it, but I prefer keeping my work transparent and was hoping that you or one of your readers might have been in a similar situation and have a tip on how to justify the use of TDD to a potential client.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>The first thing that occurs to me when trying to answer this question is this:<i>TDD is not for the client, it is for the developer</i>.  In other words, the client should not care that you are using TDD to build this application for them.  They should care that you deliver something on-time, within budget, and meeting their application requirements.
</p>

<p>
TDD can be a powerful tool, especially if you are going in and reworking an existing application.  With work projects, every time a bug is reported I now create a test to (a) verify that the bug exists and (b) make sure that when I fix that bug, it has not broken anything else.  Scoff at the TDD crowd if you want, but there appears to be lots of evidence that including tests with your application goes a long way towards reducing bugs.  <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/yacoset/Home/how-to-avoid-writing-bugs">This article</a> speaks anecdotally about the value of TDD:
<blockquote>
 At first it wasn't clear what the benefits and trade-offs of TDD were, but an empirical study conducted on teams working at Microsoft and IBM2 found that teams practicing TDD could get up to 40% fewer bugs in their released code, but it came at a cost of taking up to 35% longer than a team developing the same software without TDD. It neither absolves TDD nor condemns it, but it can tell a product manager what he could get if he had the time to pay for it.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>We have started to stray from Hendrik's question.  In my opinion, there is no need to sell the client on TDD.  As far as the client is concerned, TDD is simply part of the whole "building the application for you" process.  At this point, I could not imagine building a web application for someone else without including tests to make sure I don't break things.  Those tests are your first line of defence when fixing the bugs you inevitably introduce into an application.  No set of tests can cover everything, but even a limited set of tests are better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
Now, if someone can tell me how to test CodeIgniter controllers using <a href="http://jamierumbelow.net/2009/08/11/setting-up-the-perfect-codeigniter-tdd-environment/">this type of setup</a>, I'll be a much-less grumpier programmer.

Thanks so much for sticking with me during my November blogging experiment.  By my reckoning, I only missed one week-day blog post (it was on a Friday, and I posted something on a Saturday to make up for it.  I will not be keeping up with that pace in the month of December, but I do expect to cover some more interesting topics.
</p>

<p>
I have contemplated making December "blog reader month" where I do some blog posts on topics suggested by my readers.  Feel free to make requests in the comments, email them to me (if you can figure out my email address), or send 'em to me via Twitter.  I promise full attribution.

            <p>I've been working on the <a href="http://www.sportsdb.org/sd/sportscaster">open source web service</a> that we make available to our clients, trying to get some caching into the application to improve performance.  It got me to thinking:  what would be the best way to get our clients to install this application.
</p>

<p>
By best way, I do not mean easiest way.  The easiest way is to say "here's the tarball, extract it and install it in place".  That's currently the method we use for distribution.  I must admit that I have been negligent in updating recent builds on the site.  The real solution here is to create an automated build system that I can use to package up newer versions of the code and put them up on the web site.
</p>

<p>
Others have suggested that I should examine the use of Pear as a way to distribute this PHP application.  That's fine, but the next time they update it would overwrite any changes they made to things like display templates.  So I guess the current method is the best...
