            <h2><a href="/2007/05/02/carpenter-or-sculptor/">Carpenter or Sculptor?</a></h2>
           <h3>May 2nd, 2007</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Now, this might sound like a weird thing to say, but as a programmer I think you fall in one of two categories:  you're a carpenter or you're a sculptor.  This relates to how you build your applications from scratch, and it says a lot about your programming style.</p>

<p>A carpenter starts with a few pieces of wood and then starts cutting them, shaping them and building something.  Carpenter developers are the ones most likely to keep their code small and elegant, like they are a craftsman building a nice piece of furniture.  They will measure and cut and shape smaller pieces to make something bigger.  They start of small, and seem to know exactly how to fit the pieces together, often creating code that is easy to extend.  Sometimes there are few unnecessary pieces (think of it as intricated carvings) but, damnit, their code always looks good.  Sadly, this is not me.</p>

<p>Sculptor developers, on the other hand, start off with a large block of raw code.  Then they start to see the application and start to chip away at, smoothing things, carving what you see inside it. You find flaws that are hard to overcome, but you do your best to work around them.  In the end, you keep going until you see the vision you had at the beginning, and you've removed everything that isn't needed to make the vision happen.  This is how I tend to do things.</p>

<p>
Which method is better?  I'm not really sure.  I think the carpenter will get stuff done faster because they start with less, slowly adding onto it by concentrating on making sure everything fits together nicely.  The sculptor takes longer because they create a huge base of code and that start removing things, or reshaping the application as they go along.  In the end, you get to the same point, a working application, but was it worth all the effort?
</p>

<p>I started thinking about this today because I'm building an Ajax-powered playlist editor for my IPTV project at work.  I banged out a ton of code for the editor and, frankly, I'm not happy with it all.  I feel like I've done this the brute-force way and that I will be doing some heavy refactoring to get to that elegant, "metrosexual" code that my boss seems to effortlessly create.  He's a carpenter in the way he builds his code, and I'm striving to learn all I can.  His refactoring skills are great, which is good for a sculptor like me.  Could I ever be a carpenter?  I find it unlikely, but I can learn to apply a precision chainsaw to my big block of raw code to get to the finished product faster.  Let me know in the comments what category you feel you are under.

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I've become a convert to the design concept that says when you build something with an MVC pattern, you should have fat models and skinny controllers.  What does this really mean?  It means that you put as much of your business logic as you can into your models and all the controller should be doing is retrieving data from the model and passing it to the view.  Nice and simple, but a very powerful concept once you start doing it.</p>

<p>So, despite my problems using the RADAR concept for the <a href="http://www.ibl.org">Internet Baseball League</a> web site, I did do the models and controllers the way I wanted.  Here's what I'm talking about:
<br />
(Note the use of overriding the default table and database names.  CakePHP lets you use legacy databases, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise)

/**
 * Model for accessing schedule table

 * @author Chris Hartjes
 */

class Schedule extends AppModel
{
    var $name = 'Schedule';
    var $useTable = 'sched2007';
    var $useDbConfig = 'stats';

    function get($week) {
        $scheduledGames = array();
        $team = array("a01" => "BUF", "a02" => "COU", "a03" => "HAG", "a04" => "TRI",
                    "a05" => "BOW", "a06" => "MCM", "a07" => "PHI", "a08" => "WMS",
                    "a09" => "LAW", "a10" => "PAD", "a11" => "POR", "a12" => "STL",
                    "n01" => "CSP", "n02" => "COL", "n03" => "MIN", "n04" => "SDQ",
                    "n05" => "BUZ", "n06" => "CAJ", "n07" => "DTR", "n08" => "SCS",
                    "n09" => "CRE", "n10" => "MAD", "n11" => "SEA", "n12" => "SPO");
        $results = $this->findAll("home LIKE 'a%' AND week = " . (int)$week);
        $data = array();

        foreach ($results as $result) {
            $home = $team[$result['Schedule']['home']];
            $away = $team[$result['Schedule']['away']];
            $data[$home] = array('home' => $home, 'away' => $away);
        }

        asort($data);

        foreach ($data as $home => $matchup) {
            $scheduledGames[$home] = $matchup;
        }

        $results = $this->findAll("home LIKE 'n%' AND week = " . (int)$week);
        $data = array();

        foreach ($results as $result) {
            $home = $team[$result['Schedule']['home']];
            $away = $team[$result['Schedule']['away']];
            $data[$home] = array('home' => $home, 'away' => $away);
        }

        asort($data);

        foreach ($data as $home => $matchup) {
            $scheduledGames[$home] = $matchup;
        }
        
        return $scheduledGames;
    }
}

Now *that* is a fat model.  I'm manipulating all the business logic within my model and returning it.  Now, here's what the controller looks like:
<br />

/**
 * Controller for displaying individual weeks
 * of the IBL schedule
 *
 * @author Chris Hartjes
 */

class ScheduleController extends AppController
{
    var $name = 'Schedule';
    var $uses = array('Schedule', 'Game');
    var $layout = 'rosters';
    var $cacheAction = "1 day";

    function index($week)
    {
        $game = new Game();
        $week = (int)$week;

        if ($week == 0) {
            $week = $game->getMaxWeek();
        }

        $schedule = new Schedule();
        $this->set('schedule', $schedule->get($week));
        $this->set('week', $week);
        $this->set('maxWeek', $game->getMaxWeek());
        $this->set('scheduleWeek', $week);
    }

}
~~~
</p>

<p>See, the schedule controller is nice and thin.  All it does is get the week as a parameter passed into it via the URL and then tells the model to give me all me the schedule for the week.  Simple, easy to understand and even easier to maintain.</p>

<p>
I know that sometimes these things don't make sense at first but once you actually use them...and then have to go and modify something you quickly realize just what advantage you are getting from it.  Try seeing if you can refactor your MVC-based app (CakePHP or otherwise) to have Fat Models and Thin Controllers.

           <h3>April 24th, 2007</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Being a programmer with Attention Deficit Disorder when it comes to new ideas.  I'm always interested in new ideas, technologies and programming languages.  So, since I had been doing some work with web services I found the RADAR idea very interesting.  I even posted some code snippets and thoughts about it.  Then I went and tried to actually implement it.  Not so good.
</p>

<p>
The pages worked fine in Firefox, but IE was complaining all over the place about it.  Bad XSLT and other weird errors.  Since I had to get the thing fixed in short order, I followed my "just build it, damnit" mantra and ripped out all my code that called the REST service and did it without the web service.  Am I disappointed?  Hell yes.  I was *convinced* this was a good idea.  But perhaps the truth of the matter was that I was trying to solve a problem that did not exist, with the lofty goal of "make your application the API" that I've seen espoused in many places.
</p>

<p>
So what went wrong?  I still have no clue.  All I can do is go back to what I did and try it again.  On the surface it should've worked properly.  The problem with what I was doing was that with it spitting back information via XML, debugging things when they've gone wrong is hard.  Or maybe it's hard *for me* because I haven't spent much time doing something like this.</p>

<p>
That's really the downside to playing with new technologies:  if you're not 100% sure how to debug it when it goes wrong, you could end up doing more harm than good.  I think REST is still a really good method by which to "make the site your API".  I can now spend some time looking at it and seeing if I can't figure out just where I went wrong.</p>
