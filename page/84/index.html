            <p>Man, my blogging pace has slowed right down.  Not doing anything particularly exciting will do that to you. So, I thought I'd take a break from trying to diagnose a production-only bug (you know, the type of bug where the code runs perfectly in dev but doesn't work properly in production) that is mocking me, and taunting me while I feel the burn from starting the <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">100 pushups challenge</a> (damn you Twitter for the peer pressure!).  In case you're wondering, I am starting at rank 1 because I think I have the upper body strength of a man twice my age.</p>

<p>
Last week I wrote more Javascript code than PHP code, which is an interesting trend so it has me thinking about front end development a little more.  I still suck at interfaces (Rallyhat's UI is giving me analysis paralysis) but recent developments make me feel a little better.
</p>

<p>
In a previous post (not gonna self link, so search for it) I talked about why can't I have an all-Javascript back-end talking to an Erlang server.  Well, other than the fact that I don't know any Erlang I mean.  This is why projects like <a href="http://sproutcore.com">Sproutcore</a> have me excited.  Never mind the whole "Cocoa on the web angle" that a lot of people are talking up when describing it.  It's exciting because it is promoting a "back-end neutral" philosophy and emphasizing that people who ignore Javascript are turning their backs on a lot of good functionality.
</p>

<p>
Javascript + any back end that can spit out JSON is really what a Sproutcore application is.   I know the word paradigm shift is thrown out there a lot and is really overused, but I think the fact that something like Sproutcore is out there shows that web development itself is undergoing a shift.  I know that there are lots of examples of advanced Javascript + some back end in use (GMail, anyone?) but the fact that Sproutcore is getting some backing from Apple should tell you how important some people feel this type of application architecture could be.
</p>

<p>
It also simply reinforces my thoughts that knowing one language is no longer enough.  Just think of what you would need to understand in order to build something in Sproutcore using, say, CakePHP as the back-end:
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS (can't have those pages looking ugly, right?)</li>
<li>Javascript (although I'm wondering if jQuery and Sproutcore can co-exist)</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>SQL (have to be able to understand the queries being generated)</li>
<li>JSON (does that really count as a language or is it just encoding really?)
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>
The funny thing is that I now use this stuff without really considering that they are separate.  I just use 'em all, and abuse my relationships with people who are smarter than me to fill in the gaps.  It's the only way, really. :)
</p>

<p>
I believe Sproutcore is just the first of many Javascript application frameworks that will come out, so keep an eye peeled for the copycats and the "I did this because my problem is so unique that I could not use an existing solution" crowd.  The signal-to-noise ratio will be low, but worth wading through.

            <p>I lost my cellphone last night, which sucks because the phone I want isn't going to be available until July 11th.  I'll get a loaner phone until then, but it is exciting times to be a web developer.  Why?  Because the introduction of the iPhone there is a renewed interest in web sites that cope well with mobile browsing.  I'm working on an app that is perfect for mobile browsing, but that is still down the road.</p>

<p>
Anyhow, I saw a post the other day showing how to create an <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2008/06/09/how-to-create-an-optimized-version-of-your-website-for-the-iphone-in-symfony-1-1">iPhone-optimized version of your Symfony app</a>.  Yawn.  Cake <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/building-an-iphone-app-in-a-day">had that a year ago.</a>.  No code provided *but* the article does tell you exactly how he did it.
</p>

<p>
But that's really the key here.  You don't need to do anything special to make a web-based app in CakePHP that will work nicely on your iPhone.  Contrast that to all the stuff I see in that article that you need to do.  Off the top of my head, it seems to me the best way to do it is:
<ul>
<li>create CSS and layouts for regular and iPhone versions of your application</li>
<li>do a check in your beforeFilter() method where you check the User-Agent</li>
<li>pass that info to your actions, and render whichever layout+CSS you need</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Compare the Symfony article to the CakePHP article plus my notes, and let me know what you think.</p>

            <p>I know I don't talk much about my life outside of programming, but for the past 12 years I've been running a team in the <a href="http://www.ibl.org">Internet Baseball League</a>, and have been the commissioner for 10 of those years.  I'm also on the design team for the <a href="http://iblgame.ibl.org">dice-and-charts baseball game we use for the league</a>.  My contribution has been writing Perl scripts to generate the ratings we use for our throwing arms and baserunning ratings.  Anyhow, I (and other league members) wonder if people use the game to run their own replays, as most of us just play in the IBL and that's it.  My friend Sean told me today via IM that one guy emailed him with a spreadsheet showing him the results of a replay in progress of the Boston Red Sox 2007 season.  Here's what this guy said:
<blockquote>
"I am replaying the 2007 Red Sox with IBL and thought you might like to
   see the stats to date (attached). I am using retrosheet.org and am
   playing the "as played "starting lineups. Relief pitchers are used as
   closely to "as played" usage as possible, but obviously game situations
   dictate which relievers appear in a particular game.
   Let me know what you think. While individual averages will invariably
   vary, through 77 games the team batting average is identical to the
   actual 2007 (full) season and OBP is only .04 from the actual. I truly
   appreciate the time and effort that you have devoted to making this
   game so accurate."
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>One of the things we pride ourselves is all the work that we've put into TIG (The IBL Game as it's called) to make it not only one of the most accurate dice-and-charts baseball simulation games out there, but also to give it away for free.  All that hard work is worth it when you see e-mails like this.
