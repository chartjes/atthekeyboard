            <p><i>This is the final in a series of blog posts about programmers who make me feel stupid due to the amazing work they've done and their ability to explain it.  Check out my thoughts on <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/01/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-geoffrey-grosenbach/">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a>, <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/02/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-antirez/">Antirez</a>, <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/03/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-rich-hickey/">Rich Hickey</a> and <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/04/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-ezra-zygmuntowicz/">Ezra Zygmuntowicz.</a></i></p>

<p>I am, for lack of a better phrase, a framework whore.  I use frameworks to build all my web applications.  Why?  Because I prefer to stand on the shoulder of giants rather than constantly reinvent things.  But in many ways, my addiction to frameworks is counter-productive because I find myself constantly wanting to use a new one.  So I end up churning instead of pushing forwards.   I've been learning Zend Framework, and I'm struggling.  Too many ways to do things, too much documentation that provides me with a tease of what it is I'm trying to do but not the full solution.  Then I have to ask people for help and feel stupid for not being the Rock Star Developer(tm) with all the answers.  
</p>

<p>
So, even though I use Zend Framework now (unless I change my mind, get pissed off and go with the <a href="http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/38-The-no-framework-PHP-MVC-framework.html">no-framework framework</a>) I do watch other frameworks.  While I might not agree with some features of <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">Symfony</a>, I am astounded at what <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org/">Fabien Potencier</a> continues to produce.
</p>

<p>
Creating a framework is an achievement in itself.  Creating a framework in a language as your first real PHP project, like Fabien did, is nothing short of amazing.  Symfony is a full-stack framework, the kind of comfy and warm blanket I like to use when building an application on a short timeline.  Like many other full-stack frameworks, they also wrote stuff that other people had already written.  It's a common thing, everyone goes through the "not invented here" phase.  Sometimes, that's the only way you learn how to do something.
</p>

<p>
But as Symfony glides smoothly along towards a 2.0 release, imagine the shock of people when they see Fabien talk about how he is going to use parts of Zend Framework in the 2.0 core and dump existing components like their own unit-testing framework in favour of PHPUnit.
</p>

<p>
In the blog post about <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2010/03/04/symfony-2-0-and-the-php-ecosystem">decisions about Symfony 2</a>, he mentions the logic surrounding what appears to be a new public philosophy from Symfony: "Use what's out there; realise it sucks; write your own; wait until others suck less; dump your own; use other."
</p>

<p>
This is a very refreshing stance for the guiding power of a popular web application framework to take.  It reminds me of when Rails and Merb decided to quit fighting and instead become the same project in Rails 3.  The hater in me thinks that it's because Merb was becoming what Rails wanted to be, so kudos to the effort to rework Rails to make it better.  After all, that's the goal -- to produce better, faster software.
</p>

<p>
So why does Fabien make me feel stupid:  <b>His constant willingness to do the right thing for his project, even if it means tossing away stuff that spent a long time working on.</b>  Again, just like all the others I've talked about here, he does an amazing job of explaining what he did in a way that makes it obvious.  His thoughts on <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org/article/11/what-is-dependency-injection">dependency injection</a> helped me to understand why it's important to consider it when building your applications.  I've written code that uses it and code that does not.  I found it easier to refactor code when I used dependency injection, but that just might be me.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for following this series this week.  I hoped I've exposed you to some people you might not have heard of or known about their work.

            <p><i>This is the 4th out of 5 blog posts about programmers who I find make me feel stupid when I read what they write or hear them speak.  Stupid because what they say is so obvious I cannot believe I missed it.  See my thoughts on <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/01/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-geoffrey-grosenbach/">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a>, <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/02/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-antirez/">Antirez</a> and <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/03/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-rich-hickey/">Rich Hickey</a>.</i>
</p>

<p>
Next up is another prominent member of the Ruby community, one that I feel truly deserves the label "Renaissance Programmer".  He is <a href="http://brainspl.at/">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://www.engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>, probably the leader in helping people deploy Rails applications of all shapes and sizes.  Ezra seems to have done it all, from Rails work, to <a href="http://merbivore.com/">Merb</a>, to the Ruby VM <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinus</a>.
</p>

<p>
If I remember correctly, I first encountered Ezra and his work (and his awesome last name) during my Ruby on Rails research.  Realizing that Rails was the dominate framework in that space, I wondered what the alternatives were.  That lead me to Merb.  Unfortunately at the time it was not well-documented, so I drifted into other things (like so many other times, I'm sensing a pattern here).  Then I started hearing about the efforts to create an alternative to the standard Ruby virtual machine, with the goal of creating, I imagine, a faster Ruby environment.
</p>

<p>Much as I cannot imagine writing my own programming language, I could not imagine creating a virtual machine based on running code in an already-established language.  Then I saw <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMklv40YMY">this talk</a> Ezra gave about Merb, Rubinus and the stack that Engine Yard uses.  What blew me away was when he started explaining *how* he was going about implementing Rubinus.  It made so much sense.
</p>

<p>
See, in the Ruby world you can use what they call Matz' Ruby Interpreter, or CRuby as a reference point.  Since there is no official spec, the MRI is used.  So if you want to create your own Ruby virtual machine, it's as simple as looking at how the MRI implements functionality and then copy it in your own VM.  Repeat until your own virtual machine passes all the tests in the <a href="http://rubyspec.org/">RubySpec</a> project and bingo!  You have a (hopefully as close to compatible with the MRI) virtual machine for running Ruby.  It seems that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YARV">YARV</a> is a virtual machine (I believe it is a bytecode interpreter) that is included with the latest version of Ruby at this writing, 1.9.
</p>

<p>
So why does Ezra make me feel stupid: <b>He has fully immersed himself in the Ruby world from the virtual machine to the language implementation to frameworks that sit on top of it.  Like most of the people I talk about in this series, he also knows how to explain these things to people in such a way that you do not realize what awesome work he is doing.</b>
</p>

<p>
I may not be doing anything with Ruby any more, but how can you not get interested in the nuts-and-bolts of a language and virtual machines in general when someone like Ezra explains it to you?!?  In the PHP world, Facebook recently announced the release and open sourcing of <a href="http://wiki.github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/">Hip Hop for PHP</a>.  This project takes PHP code, parses it and generates C++ executables.  This is a big deal for Facebook, who is the largest user of PHP out there.  It lets them use approximately 50% fewer servers when delivering PHP-results.  They did the same thing I talked about above:  looked at how PHP implemented functions at the lowest level, and then figured out how to do it in C++.  It's a very unique project, and obviously not for everyone.  But again, an awesome case study on creating virtual machines / alternate runtimes for an existing programming language.

            <p><i>This is the third in a series of blog posts where I talk about people who's skills as programmers make me feel stupid.  Check out my thoughts on <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/01/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-geoffrey-grosenbach/">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a> and <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/02/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-antirez/">Antirez</a>.</i>

<p>
As a person who learned the hard way about how tough it is creating web applications that can handle state and concurrency  issues (if you've ever seen MySQL replication lag times as high as 30 *minutes* you can sympathize), the rise of languages designed from the ground up to support concurrency has caught my eye.  If you've heard of <a href="http://erlang.org">Erlang</a> or <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> you are somewhat familiar with the topic.
</p>

<p>
Then one day I ran across <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, a language that is a dialect of Lisp but runs on the JVM.  My, my, what in interesting combination.  I've talked about Clojure before, but I have not talked about the amazing person behind it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey">Rich Hickey</a>.
</p>

<p>
The idea of <a href="http://createyourproglang.com/">creating your own programming language</a> is one that I find extremely intimidating, not having a formal background in computer science.  I have a vague idea of how you would do it:  write parsers for your code and then compile them into byte code that can be run by something.  Very simplistic, I know.
</p>

<p>
So Rich Hickey is a one of these programming gurus who I am sure is a super-nice guy but I would be totally intimidated to have any sort of meaningful programming-related discussion with.  First of all, he's a Lisp hacker.  Some of my friends have described Lisp as "the cockroach of the programming world, which will be around long after the sun of other languages have dimmed" and I can't say that I disagree much with that statement.  For someone who learned to program by teaching himself PHP, Lisp's syntax takes a lot of getting used to.  
</p>

<p>But then I think the best trick was making Clojure run on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jvm">JVM</a>.  Why do I think this is significant?  It means that if there is a feature or a library that doesn't exist in Clojure, you can always use a Java equivalent (if such a one exists).  In Tim Bray's "Concur Next" series he showed an example where he used a Java library in Clojure to help him speed things up.
</p>

<p>
So not only does he have a well-designed and well-thought-out programming language, he is also great at explaining programming concepts.  Go and watch this video on the topic of <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey">basic principles like state, identity, value, time, and many others</a> in order to understand how to build concurrent and parallel systems.  Fascinating talk, and I highly recommend seeking out other talks that he's done as well.
</p>

<p>
All this stuff is absolutely fascinating to me, because my entire programming career has been spent in the stateless environment of the web.  Oh sure, we can fake state and concurrency using sessions and cookies, but they are really just hacks.  Does a web application need to be stateful and/or concurrent?  The answer is, of course, it depends. ;)  Online games with multiple participants definitely need to worry about sharing state across multiple clients, and any web application that is taking large amounts of data and processing it (like munging it together based on aggregate conditions) could benefit from being able to crunch the data concurrently, with all jobs reporting stuff as they go.  Any task that would benefit from being broken down into smaller tasks that can be run at once is a candidate for concurrency.
</p>

<p>
So, why does Rich Hickey make me feel stupid?  <b>Not only is he also capable of explaining the hows and whys of a concurrent programming language, he is encouraging people to think ahead to the next generation of programming problems and potential solutions to those problems.</b>.  It's highly unlikely I will ever create a full-blown, general-purpose programming language.  But Rich Hickey's work has gotten me thinking about programming in event-driven environments, and wondering what tasks that my current applications perform could benefit from concurrency and parallelism.
