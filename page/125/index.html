            <p>I normally don't talk about other blogs that I like to read, but I decided this might be a nice time to share some of them
<ul>
<li><a href="http://yarivsblog.com">Yariv's Blog</a> is the blog of programmer Yariv Sadan.  He's doing a lot of work to bring Erlang to the web via his <a href="http://erlyweb.org/">ErlyWeb</a> web framework.  Why do I keep coming back?  Part of me wants to build something in Erlang because it can handle the type of high concurrency, synchronous web applications that Web 2.0 seems to be pushing us towards.</li>
<li>Jamis Buck has three Ruby-related blogs I like to go to: <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/">the { buckblogs :here }</a>, he contributes to <a href="http://blog.caboo.se/">~:caboose</a> and he also contributes to <a href="http://www.therailsway.com">The Rails Way</a>, where they take user submitted code and suggest refactorings for it.  Jamis is one of the smartest guys I've ever come across on the web, so I never hesitate to take a look at what he's talking about.</li>
<li>I find myself going to the <a href="http://www.whenpenguinsattack.com">Jaslabs</a> high-performance PHP page more and more often these days.  Great articles and tips for the more advanced programmer.  You can always use some help.</li>
<li>My friend Amy Hoy runs <a href="http://slash7.com">Slash7</a> where she talks about her experiences with Rails and user interfaces.  Oh yeah, go buy her Javascript book when it comes out!</li>
<li>If you're into CakePHP at all, go visit <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org">ThinkingPHP and beyond</a> where Felix will give you some insight into the inner workings of the CakePHP web framework</li>
</ul>

            <p>My apologies for the lateness (and shortness) of this post.  Real life has intruded this week.  More news on this later.  But here's what's jumping around in my brain:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cake.insertdesignhere.com/">Nate</a> from CakePHP is helping me out with the work on my proposal for an interactive console.  Trax (a Cake "competitor") has an interactive shell so I'm taking a look at how they are doing things to see what I can use from it.  Thank you open source licensing!</li>
<li>There has been great feedback from those who watched the screencast of my talk from Vancouver and I'm going to tweak the talk for May.  Remove some slides, avoid duplication and build up the parts that drew a lot of interest:  deployment and programmer ego.</li>
<li>I'm going to have to dive into the slightly old <a href="http://www.typosphere.org">Typo</a> install and figure out how to stop the huge amounts of trackback spam we've been getting.  Seems that the Typo install I'm running ignores requests to stop accepting trackbacks.  Gotta fix that by hacking at the source</li>
</ul>

        <div>
            <p>Back in September when I was at php|works I did an <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/1701">interview</a> with Cal Evans, the editor of Zend's Dev Zone.  We chatted for about 30 minutes about various topics (we have similar introductions to the world of computers) but he had to cut it off there.  We had even more interesting discussions during the course of the conference, but a lot of those will have to stay buried for the time being...
