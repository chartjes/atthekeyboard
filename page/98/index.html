C'mon ,you know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duran_duran">Duran Duran</a> kicks ass!  I was trying to think of a catchy title for a series of posts as I wind my way through the building of my first <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> app, using the <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> framework.  If you've used any other framework, you should be able to follow along with these posts as the concepts are all pretty much the same.
</p>

<p>
First off, I have great hopes that the <a href="http://tempdocs.cakephp.org">current CakePHP 1.2 manual</a> can morph into a resource as great as <a href="http://www.djangobook.com">The Django Book</a>, which looks to me to be the essential resource for anyone wishing to start off with Django.  Everything I'm doing at this stage in the project builds on what I've covered so far.</p>

<p>
Anyway, I've chose to build out Rallyhat, my sporting road planning site.  Much like when I build a <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> app, I start out with the models.  Django has a pretty good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> component, as compared to the associated data mapping model that CakePHP uses.  Now, to paraphrase from the Django book:  "introspection is hard", so in order to give the Model ORM some help you define the fields you will be using in your models.  Here are the definitions I'm using:
~~~
from django.db import models

class Sport(models.Model) :
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


class Team(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    sport = models.ForeignKey(Sport)
    city = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    state_province = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    country = models.CharField(max_length=30)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
                
                
class Game(models.Model):
    home_team = models.ForeignKey(Team, related_name='home_team')
    away_team = models.ForeignKey(Team, related_name='away_team')
    start_date = models.DateTimeField()
    sport = models.ForeignKey(Sport)
    
    
    def __str__(self):
        return '%s vs. $s' (self.away_team, self.home_team)

~~~
</p>

<p>
As you can see, I'm able to define all my fields I'm going to use with generic data types, and can even define the associations between the tables.  So, why do we do all this? Well, Django comes with some great CLI tools for helping you build stuff.  In fact, I dare say that you cannot build a Django application *without* using these tools.  Once you've defined the models you want to use, you validate the models using 'python manage.py validate', and it reports any problems it found.
</p>

<p>
While I was building this out, it told me that it couldn't determine the foreign keys I wanted, so I quickly figured out I had to put Sport first in the definition list, then Team, so that Game would know what to reference for the foreign keys.  It also told me that I had to set a 'related_name' attribute for my foreign keys in Game since I was reference the same model twice for a foreign key.  Very similar to how you can alias an association in Cake.
</p>

<p>
Okay, once that's done I can then get it to generate the actual SQL needed to create those models using 'python manage.py sqlall rh' (with 'rh' being what I'm calling the application within Django).  In this case I'm using a Postgres backend, so it generated SQL specifically for Postgres.
[sql]
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE "rh_game" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "home_team_id" integer NOT NULL,
    "away_team_id" integer NOT NULL,
    "start_date" timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
    "sport_id" integer NOT NULL
)
;
CREATE TABLE "rh_sport" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
)
;
ALTER TABLE "rh_game" ADD CONSTRAINT sport_id_refs_id_66e4cc9c FOREIGN KEY ("sport_id") REFERENCES "rh_sport" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
CREATE TABLE "rh_team" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "sport_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "rh_sport" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED,
    "city" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "state_province" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "country" varchar(30) NOT NULL
)
;
ALTER TABLE "rh_game" ADD CONSTRAINT home_team_id_refs_id_20e54e34 FOREIGN KEY ("home_team_id") REFERENCES "rh_team" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
ALTER TABLE "rh_game" ADD CONSTRAINT away_team_id_refs_id_20e54e34 FOREIGN KEY ("away_team_id") REFERENCES "rh_team" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
CREATE INDEX "rh_game_home_team_id" ON "rh_game" ("home_team_id");
CREATE INDEX "rh_game_away_team_id" ON "rh_game" ("away_team_id");
CREATE INDEX "rh_game_sport_id" ON "rh_game" ("sport_id");
CREATE INDEX "rh_team_sport_id" ON "rh_team" ("sport_id");
COMMIT;
[/sql]
</p>

<p>
Man, it creates the indexes too!  Okay, now that I'm happy with that all I have to is 'python manage.py syncdb' and it goes and actually creates the tables (and indexes) for me.  I took a look at the 'schema' task that exists for the Cake console (try 'cake schema' if you have already configured the console for use and poke around) and it will do similar things for you.  Nicely done, gwoo!
<pre>
(chartjes@jackjack ~/Sites/rallyhat)
>python manage.py syncdb
Creating table rh_game
Creating table rh_sport
Creating table rh_team
Installing index for rh.Game model
Installing index for rh.Team model
(chartjes@jackjack ~/Sites/rallyhat)
>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Bingo, presto!  We have our tables created for us!
</p>

<p>
I hope you've enjoyed this little glimpse into Django (and how it relates to CakePHP, in an obtuse way I guess).  Next time we invoke the spirit of Duran Duran, I'll be showing how I built a search form to find all games for a particular team, showing how Django's MTV (Model-Template-View) system works.

            <p>
While speaking with <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2007/dec/php-advent-calendar-day-24">nate</a> last night via IM, he told me about the latest set of changes for CakePHP 1.2.  There is simply just too much to mention, so I suggest heading on over to the brand-spanking-new <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP home page</a> and checking out the <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/wiki/changelog/1.2.x.x">changelog</a>.  There's a lot in there, but take the time to go through it. Besides, you might find that a particular bug that had been bothering you has been fixed.
</p>

<p>
My own modest contribution to the latest release was contributing some work in the 'bake' utility to allow you to select what database configuration you wanted to use (it was hard-coded before), and allowing you to bake a plugin (which is sort of like a stand-alone module within an application.   Yes, there were a few tweaks afterwards by gwoo but he told me (or maybe lied to me to soothe my ego) that a lot of my code was still in there.
</p>

<p>
So, CakePHP 1.2 stable looks like it's getting closer and closer, so don't be afraid to move from 1.1 to 1.2.  The improvements are worth it as 1.2.x is probably the most stable piece of "alpha" or "beta" software I've come across.

Since the summer, something had been bothering me about PHP.  I couldn't put my finger on it but over the holidays I finally figured out what was wrong.  After ten years of working with PHP, I'm bored with it.  Every professional programming job I've ever had has involved PHP as the main language, with a smattering of things like SQL, Perl, Ruby and Javascript.  But it's always PHP at the core.
</p>

<p>
So what is there left for me to do with PHP?  I'm not about to write my own PHP framework as I <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">have one I already like</a>, one that I use for my <a href="http://www.ibl.org">simulation baseball league's web site</a>.  I'm not a C programmer, so diving into the internals of PHP to contribute that way is a no go.  No, it's time to put PHP aside (so to speak) and pour my energies into something else.
</p>

<p>
A while back I tried the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails thing</a>.  I liked it...because it was so different from PHP.  Ruby has such elegant syntax, reading like English in many ways.  I even got asked to create a training course for Ruby on Rails, but never got far with it (sorry <a href="http://mtabini.blogspot.com/">Marco</a>).  Once I started poking around more about Rails, I started to see things that made me uneasy about it:  issues about performance in high-traffic environments, the attitude of some of the more senior "core" guys in Rails, and the zealotry displayed by users of it.  
</p>

<p>Slam PHP all you want for it's syntax ($object->chaining->looks->weird()), it's inconsistency in function parameter order, the still-ongoing debate about how to implement namespaces, and the combo of powerful functionality combined with a low barrier of entry (thereby infuriating programming snobs).  But it gets shit done, plain and simple.  That's how Rasmus Lerdorf started off using PHP, that's how it will always be.  Elegance in code and proper programming techniques are the domain of the developer, not the language in my not-so-humble opinion.
</p>

<p>
Sure, Ruby is nice and Rails has all those cool magic functions but some stuff I read by <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">Zed Shaw</a> (the creator of <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">Mongrel</a> put into words a lot of what I had felt about Rails:  just not for me, I guess.
</p>

<p>
So what's left?  Not gonna go the Java route:  too much pain and suffering lies down that path.  So, I'm left looking at a language that is rock solid, has a great object model, has a good web application framework to help me get up to speed and lots and lots and LOTS of great documentation and tutorials:  Python.
</p>

<p>
I won't be giving up getting PAID to do PHP code any time soon because I have a great job with a great bunch of guys, and I get to work from home.  But I just feel it's time to focus my energies on something else.  Python is very similar to Ruby, and let's be honest here:  I've got enough programming experience that there shouldn't be much of a learning curve for me to figure out Python.  Python code just looks nice and clean, less writing to get more done.  That's what I'm really looking for these days.
</p>

<p>
The simball web site continues to grow and get new features, so I will be leveraging CakePHP to the hilt in that respect.  It's an exciting time for CakePHP as they are heading towards 1.2 and preparing for 2.0.  But I am not sure what my contribution to the project will be any more, which hasn't been much lately but I am interested in helping push the CLI tools forward as not only can they help me, they can help other developers as well.  But it is time for a change.  Maybe one of these days I find a job programming in Python, or even manage to push Python in through the back door where I currently work.  But the time is absolutely right for me to start learning Python and make it a tool I want to use on a regular basis instead of it continually being on my list of "things to do when I feel up to it".
</p>

<p>
I've got my copy of "Dive Into Python" in PDF, been going through the Python tutorials (wow, the interactive interpreter is great) and getting ready to bust out a Django install.  But make no mistake:  PHP pays the bills, but it's time to start using other people's tools to get the job done.  Time to quit fooling myself that I'm going to make some sort of earth-shattering contribution to PHP, and save my brainpower for learning Python the way I've learned PHP.
</p>

<p>
Wish me luck!
