            <p>"Why are you stopping the conference?!?"</p>

<p>This is the most common question I've been asked since earlier in the year when
my conference partner Pete and I decided that we would run our small PHP-centric
conference TrueNorthPHP one more time and then shut it down.</p>

<p>While there are some short answers, there are also some very long ones. I did
30 minute closing talk at the end of the conference to talk about my feelings
about all this. Since not everyone was able to be there, I thought I'd rehash
some of my thoughts on this so others can learn from my experiences and draw their own
conclusions.</p>

<p>I absolutely picked the right partner for all this in Pete. I was able
to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_man">hype man</a> for the event
while Pete...did pretty much everything else. This, of course, was right in my
ego-driven, self-promoting wheel house. Talk all the time about something cool
I am doing and what others to participate in? EASY. Make sure speakers are
treated the way I wanted to be treated? DONE. Keep everything on track
during the event and keep the talk flow going? SIMPLE.</p>

<p>Because of this great partnership, doing the conference never felt stressful.
Seriously. We knew what we needed to do, and made sure we got the right help
for the things we couldn't do ourselves. The staff at Microsoft Canada did
everything we needed...and then some. An extreme pleasure to deal with once
we got things rolling, they often anticipated our needs and always delivered.</p>

<p>I know you might not believe me, but it's true -- we set things up so this
event would run smoothly with some oversight from us instead of becoming an
all-consuming monster like some conferences seem to be for other folks.</p>

<p>So 5 times I asked for people to submit talks, encouraged my old friends and
hopeful strangers to submit talks, picked people up at the airport, tried to
talk to all of them during the event itself, shook a lot of hands, thanked
many people for compliments, and just tried to do what I thought was right.</p>

<p>Clearly it worked because I did notice all the people talking about the event
over the years. I'm happy it all worked out so well and I'm happy so many
other people looked at what Pete and I did as inspiration for running their
own events.</p>

<p>But <em>why</em> did I go along with shutting down such an awesome event. Sure, I
could keep doing this another 5 times. But I'm just not wired this way.</p>

<p>When Pete and I hatched a scheme to actually do this, the goal was clear --
run the first PHP-centric event in the Greater Toronto Area since 2006. I also
saw that we could bring in some awesome speakers because I had made so many
friends while speaking at events myself. The event was smaller than I wanted
it to be, but I quickly realized that we couldn't possibly run something bigger
than this with just 2 main organizers (Vic Metcalfe helped out so much over the
years).</p>

<p>So 5 times we has from 130-150 folks spend the first Friday and Saturday of
November learning about programming in a very chill environment.</p>

<p>But it's over. Done. Finished. No more TrueNorthPHP. I did everything I
wanted to do with this thing, so to me there was no point in doing it any more.
Better to go out while on top instead of let this thing linger and end up a
pale shadow of itself. If other people want to run a PHP-centric event in the
Toronto area, I'm happy to offer advice. But it won't be TrueNorthPHP.</p>

<p>I'm sure many of you are disappointed. That's okay. Many of you might find it
egotistical that I have identified so strongly with TrueNorthPHP being an
extension of myself. That's okay too. I didn't do this all just for you, I did
it to prove something to myself too. I can now add "was an integral part of a
successful developer conference" to my list of "things I did that are awesome".</p>

<p>But I always get restless. Things that were a challenge become normal, and
I start doing them without reflecting on their awesomeness. "Running a
conference" is now part of that. But don't worry, I'm not going to stop doing
them. I'm just taking what I feel is a well-deserved break from doing this
soft of stuff. I've spent almost 20 years as a programmer -- I think I've
earned a year of relaxing with my wife and concentrating on really small
tasks...like packing up and moving after 13 years to try and find a Compound
of Grumpiness in a slightly-rural-but-has-high-speed-internet location.</p>

<p>At some point the restlessness will kick in and I will want to run an event.
I have some ideas -- the early feedback seems interesting but it needs to
percolate and roll around in my head until I fully figure out what it's
going to be. The likelihood of there being a GrumpyCon in 2018 is very strong.</p>

<p>Like I said at the end of my talk, I cannot possibly thank everyone that helped
me and Pete put on such a great event over the past few years. Instead, I will
say "see you soon".</p>
