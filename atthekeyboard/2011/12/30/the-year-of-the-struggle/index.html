            <h2>The Year of the Struggle <small>post</small></h2>
            <h3>December 30th, 2011</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>For those who know me outside of the context of my ranty tweets and 
occasionally-lucid blog posts you will know that I am an avid simulation
baseball game player. I'm about to start my 15th season in my current
league and it has taught me a great many lessons about myself and the importance
of having a set of skills that turn independent bits into a cohesive team.</p>

<p>(If you care the league uses a game that it creates itself using freely-available
data from <a href="http://retrosheet.org">Retrosheet</a> and if you've ever come across
<a href="http://www.strat-o-matic.com/products/baseball">Strat-O-Matic-Baseball</a> you might
have an idea of how game-play works)</p>

<p>I've had middling success in that league: some really crappy seasons where I
clearly did not know what I was doing along with making the playoffs 3 years
out of 4 complete with a trip to our league champsionship series. Many times
I've had teams where the skills of the players (who are merely statistical
representations within the confines of the game rules) simply aren't a good
fit.</p>

<p>If you have lots of power, a good bullpen, but guys who don't get on-base
you will find yourself winning by a lot or losing by a lot because
power comes and goes. If you have great pitching but a bad offense (similar
to what I have for our upcoming 2012 season) then you will find yourself
in many close games but you will probably lose more of them than you win
because your offense will be unable to come through when needed.</p>

<p>I've also learned that I am a decent field manager (in terms of playing the
games and understanding strategies), lousy at evaluating hitters in our
draft (my past 4 first-round picks have been hitters who have been injured
and/or underachieved), great at evaluating pitchers, and very impatient
in the trade market when trying to improve my team.</p>

<p>I went through a terrible season last year due to a combination of bad luck
and impatience in making trades to keep a fringe playoff contender in the
playoff hunt in 2010, then crashing to lose almost 120 games in 2011. 
So I struggle to find ways to build a better team, and better identify the
combination of skills I need for my team to achieve success.</p>

<p>So what does all this have to do with programming? I feel that my current
set of skills are a terrible match for today's programming environment and
it's making me feel a set of emotions I thought I ditched when I left high
school: jealousy, fear, angst and regret.</p>

<p>I've always prided myself in thinking that I have spotted trends in programming
before everyone else. I first saw the value of frameworks in 2003-2004. About
the same time I discovered SimpleTest and thought that it would be a very
valuable tool. It's almost 2012 and I still feel the same way, but I feel like
the programming community I belong to still doesn't give a shit.</p>

<p>In February of this year I jumped on an opportunity to work with some people 
I respect in the PHP community and joined Moontoast. It had been a while
since I had done the startup thing and thought it would be a good change for
me. At my previous employer I had to do everything myself for my projects and
I looked at Moontoast as an opportunity to work with a team again.</p>

<p>Instead I struggled. Struggled to cope with two applications written using 
heavily-modified versions of two frameworks. Struggled to understand the 
business that relied on these applications. Struggled with the idea that
the things I felt really, REALLY mattered simply don't matter to the
business as a whole. It's not a lie when I say it hurt. Hurt a lot to miss
deadlines and let down team members. Hurt a lot to struggle to make things
like automated testing and simpler product development FUCKING WORK and not
achieve anything. Struggled while wondering if I was getting honest feedback
from fellow employees who might not want to really say what they feel because
they are not an asshole like I often am.</p>

<p>On top of that, I felt like the volume of tweets and blog posts I cranked
out achieved nothing that I could hang my hat on and make my ego stop 
screaming at me in my head. I still care immensely about best practices,
automation, and building applications that can be easily tested. All too often
I feel like I am the only one who wants it so bad I pound my fists on my
desk like a little boy having a fucking temper tantrum.</p>

<p>The feedback loop I want just isn't there any more. Perhaps my troll-like
existence in my home office is wearing me down and making it more difficult
for me to actually get along with people. My ego is getting in the way of
success in a team setting and I am struggling to find a way to figure out
how to change things for the better.</p>

<p>PHP is the tool I've been using pretty much non-stop since 1998. It won the
web battle. It really did. But things are changing and expectations are 
changing amongst the next wave of programmers. Elegance in code matters.
Ability to support concurrency at the code level matters. Perhaps it shouldn't
but it does. I think of all the investment I've made in PHP and I find myself
constantly asking the question "did you do the right thing?"</p>

<p>I have found that the PHP community is very supportive of me and my ideas, so
I'm probably not as terrible a person as I make myself out to be. But the PHP
community as a whole really seems to think that much of the stuff I consider
to be important is just a waste of time, getting in the way of getting things
done so you can go home after work.</p>

<p>The crowd I follow online is a self-selecting one. Most of them care about
the same things (except there are those who disagree with me on the importance
of automated testing as a critical part of development) but what about those
who aren't there? How many of them give a shit about clear, concise code? How
many of them have actually created an application for their employer that
had a complete testing suite (in 14 years I've been able to do that ONCE)
for it? How many of them have automated their deployments as a result of
a merge of code in their version control system?</p>

<p>It's more likely that I am being selfish and demanding recognition for the
things I've done and don't really deserve that recognition. I joke with
my wife that I am a "big deal on the Internet" and #internetfamous on Twitter,
but am I really? Or am I just loud and repeat myself over and over again. 
Am I just being tolerated or are there people for whom my thoughts are
resonating and they are going out and kicking ass in a way I have been unable
to?</p>

<p>Maybe this old saying is true: those who can, do, and those who can't, teach.</p>

<p>2011 was the year of the struggle for me. I don't want 2012 to be like that
but I am not sure how because I'm scared that I'm becoming useless and 
irrelevant and that the things I am passionate about have no place in the
modern PHP community, the only one I've ever really been a part of.</p>

<p>Hope you have a good 2012. I'll be here, struggling.</p>
