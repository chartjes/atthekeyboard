            <p>It's no secret that I have been pushing my "grumpy programmer" brand hard.
Why not? It's delivering a non-trivial amount of side income for me and I
have been really enjoying it.</p>

<p>This past fall I taught an in-person course that I called my "PHP Testing
Bootcamp" where I spent about 6 hours showing a bunch of PHP programmers
how to twist their code into testable shape. That got me to thinking that
I want to do more of that, as I found that process enjoyable as well.</p>

<p>As I also create more products I need a place for them all to live. I have
books, and now a course I can teach and I am planning on producing
screencasts for sale as well. With that in mind, I am happy to announce
I have created <a href="http://grumpy-learning.com">Grumpy Learning</a>, an umbrella
site for all my training and teaching efforts to hang from. While you are
there, please join the mailing list via the form I have up there. I promise
to not give your email address to anyone else and will give you something
every two weeks related to testing or share other thoughts I have.</p>

<p>As part of this, I will be teaching my "PHP Testing Bootcamp" course again
but this time doing it online. Check out the <a href="http://phptestingbootcamp.eventbrite.com/">site for the course</a>
for details, but here's the summary:</p>

<p>9 tickets available to do the course with me live at $250 per student. Three
session (January 3, 10 and 17) running from 9pm until about 11pm Eastern
Standard Time. I've already sold 3 of the 9, so you might want to hurry up.</p>

<p>Then I have up to 50 tickets available to get just the recordings of the
course for $125. If you can't make it due to time zone differences or
prior commitments, the videos of me teaching the course and answering
questions is a great option. I've sold 2 of these, so plenty of them
left.</p>

<p>Students who participate in the live sessions will also get access to the
videos as part of their tickets.</p>

<p>If you've ever wondered how someone who takes coding and testing seriously
works in a test-centric manner, this is your chance. Give yourself an
awesome gift for the holiday: a chance to learn how to write testable
code and the tools that make it happen.</p>
