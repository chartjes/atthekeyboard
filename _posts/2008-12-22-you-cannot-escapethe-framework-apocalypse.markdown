<h2>title: You Cannot Escape...The Framework Apocalypse</h2>

<p>For a while I had been threatening to commission a t-shirt design based on either "Framework Jihad" or "Framework Apocalypse".  The general consensus amongst my Twitter peeps was that (a) this was a great idea and (b) they would buy one.  Well, that time has come.</p>

One of my favourite webcomics is <a href="http://hijinksensue.com/portfolio/">Joel Watson's</a> <a href="http://www.hijinksensue.com">Hijinks Ensue</a>.   Joel is trying to <a href="http://hijinksensue.com/experiment/">Live The Dream</a> of being a full-time web cartoonist / merchandiser, and to this end he also does custom design work.  After about exchanging a few emails about designs, Joel cranked out this awesome t-shirt for me.

<p>
After taking a look at the various web sites that can do print-on-demand t-shirts, and reading come comparisons between them, I settled on <a href="http://www.printfection.com">Printfection.com</a>.  Once Joel sent me the final design, it took about 30 minutes from first signing up to having a working store.

<p>
So, show the world that you are not afraid of the upcoming Framework Apocalypse by going to my <a href="http://www.printfection.com/atthekeyboard">online store</a> and ordering yourself a shirt...or ten. ;)
