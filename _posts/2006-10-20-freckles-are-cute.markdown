<h2>title: Freckles Are Cute!</h2>

<p>
Congratulations to my meet-once-but-talk-all-the-time-via-IM friend <a href="http://slash7.com">Amy Hoy</a> for winning the RailsDay Contest for the app she wrote with her frind Bryan Wood called <a href="http://www.slash7.com/articles/2006/06/21/railsday-railsconf">Freckle</a>, an online app for keeping track of wedding stuff.  
</p>

<p>
I know that Amy is getting married "some time soon" (but not to Bryan) so it's no surprise that she came up with something like this.  There's a <a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2006/10/19/grand-tour-of-the-13-railsday-winners">great breakdown of the winners</a> over at <a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com">Evan Weaver's blog</a>
</p>

<p>
Congrats Amy!
