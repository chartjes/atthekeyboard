title: Deployment Is Not A 4 Letter Word - The Screencast!
author: Chris Hartjes</p>

<h2>date: 2008-04-17</h2>

<p>
I managed to make a screencast of the second talk I gave at <a href="http://www.openwebvancouver.ca">Open Web Vancouver 2008</a> about application deployment.  I had hoped to make a screencast of my CakePHP console talk, but I messed something up at my end and all I have is the audio from it.  Not the best thing when you are doing a demo.  However, the conference was also recording talks so hopefully they will have a copy of it for you to see as well.

<p>
The talk was well-attended, which is a nice boost for the ego and although I spoke too fast (as usual) I think I got all my points across quite nicely.
