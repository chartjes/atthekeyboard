(My appologies for the late posting.  DNS problems caused my site to disappear for a while but everthing is okay now).

My friend Kevin (working away overseas in Southeast Asia) pointed out the new Amazon web services to me.  Here's our conversation:


<blockquote>
9:23:18 PM chorgheavyinc: something else weird.. have you checked out amazon web services recently?
9:23:27 PM chriswebfinity: no I haven't
9:23:36 PM chorgheavyinc: aws.amazon.com
9:23:40 PM chorgheavyinc: take a look
9:24:02 PM chriswebfinity: the only web services Ive been working with lately are with last.fm/audioscrobbler.net
9:24:09 PM chriswebfinity: writing a component for the Zend Framework
9:24:09 PM chorgheavyinc: then grab your secret list of projects that you were waiting to become rich to do
9:24:31 PM chriswebfinity: um, ok
9:26:41 PM chorgheavyinc: anyway, that's the message.  when you get a chance lmk what you think.. i'd be interested in your opinon and thoughts
9:26:55 PM chorgheavyinc: lastfm looks neat
9:26:57 PM chriswebfinity: I will take a look at it for sure
9:27:46 PM chorgheavyinc: like it's crazy what could be done with it, gonna try something goofy starting Nov 1, :D
9:33:36 PM chriswebfinity: so is Amazon going to give both ends away then?
9:33:42 PM chriswebfinity: the API *and* code to use it?
9:33:45 PM chriswebfinity: Im confused
9:34:00 PM chorgheavyinc: the keystone is S3, the storage.
9:34:29 PM chorgheavyinc: that was the first thing i saw, few months ago.  
9:34:39 PM chorgheavyinc: "Cool idea" i said 
9:35:26 PM chorgheavyinc: the virtualized server ( the beta) is very interesting
9:35:35 PM chorgheavyinc: yes, they are making this available
9:36:00 PM chorgheavyinc: you have to pay sure, but only for what you use
9:37:52 PM chorgheavyinc: the broad ramifications are that you can implement a demo on your lappy, and scale that bad boy up to about youtube size
9:38:18 PM chorgheavyinc: all pay as you go, like per second cell phone rate
9:39:56 PM chriswebfinity: interesting
9:40:00 PM chorgheavyinc: like i do contracts and live in the philippines because i am saving to do the projects i  really want to do
9:40:33 PM chorgheavyinc: but... i have to reconsider now.  I have the tech expertise to do it, no question.. 
9:40:53 PM chorgheavyinc: but has the lazyweb helped me again?
9:41:19 PM chriswebfinity: it saves you when you least expect it ;)
9:41:56 PM chorgheavyinc: it sure does... it's very hard to work hard sometimes .. 
9:43:53 PM chorgheavyinc: so im taking from tomorrow until next  monday to check into this
9:48:00 PM chriswebfinity: okay, created an account
9:48:07 PM chriswebfinity: I'll see what comes to me about using it
9:48:12 PM chriswebfinity: maybe hack together a demo of something
9:48:33 PM chorgheavyinc: yeah , im thinking that too
9:49:07 PM chriswebfinity: gotta be carefull though...because they charge you could rack up a big bill testing ;)
9:49:09 PM chorgheavyinc: it is making me redefine the "but what can i do today" question
9:49:37 PM chorgheavyinc: true.. i just want to learn the api's
9:49:41 PM chorgheavyinc: i can test locally
9:53:53 PM chriswebfinity: I think the ability to use the storage is huge
9:54:01 PM chorgheavyinc: like i sure could have used S3 to back up my drive
9:54:03 PM chorgheavyinc: yes
9:54:12 PM chriswebfinity: actually...I have an idea
9:54:16 PM chriswebfinity: not sure how to pay for it though
9:54:30 PM chriswebfinity: and I've been planning on building the site even though i have no idea how to make any money of off it
9:55:03 PM chorgheavyinc: *ding*
9:55:17 PM chorgheavyinc: time to build

Very interesting stuff indeed.
