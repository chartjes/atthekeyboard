<h2>title: "Job Opening: XMLTeam Solutions"</h2>

<p>
Do you like sports?  Are you good with PHP/CSS/HTML/MySQL?  Not scared of XML?  Can you handle working remotely from the comfort of your home or a never-ending series of coffee shops with free wifi?  If so, there is an opportunity for you.
</p>

<p>
My employer, <a href="http://www.xmlteam.com">XML Team Solutions</a> is looking to hire a "Software Engineer" to replace an outgoing employee.  This is not an entry-level position as it requires solid skills in PHP, HTML/CSS/ and knowing how to build some pretty scary SQL queries.
</p>

<p>
You would be spending your days hanging out on the company IRC channel, doing tasks as assigned which include writing web apps for internal and external use, answering support tickets from our clients and tackling some interesting problems involving large data sets and traffic levels.  
</p>

<p>XML Team Solutions provides sports data to our clients formatted in XML and offers support tools for dumping that data into a relational database so you could run, for example, a fantasy football site.  We collect data from a wide variety of content sources both in North America and Europe, and we have worked with companies like Yahoo!, Google and ESPN.  If you're into sports, a good problem solver, and used to working with minimal supervision, this is the job for you.  Plus you get to work with me!  What could be better?
</p>

<p>We're a small company (6 people including myself) so you will often be asked to do non-programming tasks because, well, sometimes somebody's got to do it!  I will say that the company feels more like a team than any other place that I've ever worked.
</p>

<p>
If you're interested, send a resume to me at chris@DIESPAMMERREMOVETHISxmlteam.com.  I will only respond to those who are being considered for an interview.  DEFINITELY no recruiters or agencies allowed, thanks.
