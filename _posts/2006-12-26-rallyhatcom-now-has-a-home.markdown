<p>
Well, it's not much to look at it but I finally got rallyhat.com moved over to my new <a href="http://mediatemple.net">host</a>, so I can get to work on it.  My man <a href="http://www.mutescreamz.com/">Biz</a> is going to be helping me with graphics and the look and feel, in exchange for me teaching him some more programming.  He's a really good sysadmin (all around Mac wizard) but he wants to get his programming skills past (to quote him) "stealing other people's stuff and hacking on it until it sort of works."  Hey, that's how all of us start, but most of us get to the point where we can create our own stuff from scratch.
