<h2>title: So It Ends, Gentle Reader</h2>

<p>
Thanks so much for sticking with me during my November blogging experiment.  By my reckoning, I only missed one week-day blog post (it was on a Friday, and I posted something on a Saturday to make up for it.  I will not be keeping up with that pace in the month of December, but I do expect to cover some more interesting topics.

I have contemplated making December "blog reader month" where I do some blog posts on topics suggested by my readers.  Feel free to make requests in the comments, email them to me (if you can figure out my email address), or send 'em to me via Twitter.  I promise full attribution.
