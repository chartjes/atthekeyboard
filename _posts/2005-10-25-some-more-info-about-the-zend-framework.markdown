<h2>title: Some more info about the Zend Framework</h2>

<p>Intersting <a href="http://netevil.org/node.php?nid=633">post</a> over at Wez Furlong's blog where he talks about the Zend Framework.  Check out the comments for lots of whining and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>Why do some people hate Zend so much?  They're just trying to make money off of PHP.  Just like every developer who gets paid to work in PHP, if you ask me.</p>
