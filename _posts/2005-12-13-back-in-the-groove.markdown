<h2>title: Back in the groove</h2>

<p>I was surprised at how quickly I got into the groove working at <a href="http://www.verticalscope.com">the new job</a>, considering I knew <strong>nothing</strong> about what I would be doing when I got there.</p>

<p>For now, I'm working on making changes to <a href="http://www.tunerfriends.com">TunerFriends</a>, which is an online community for people who like to trick out and modify their cars.  It uses <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com">vBulletin</a> top power it.  I can't say I'm a big fan because the existing site, well, the code's a mess.  Lots of cut-and-pasting going on and it needs a really good cleanup and refactor.</p>

<p>I'm trying to push for a chance to do it, but who knows.  When the IT department is just part of the company, not the main focus of the company, I can see how requests like that might be ignored unless I can guarantee it takes less time.  I need to find a code profiler and unleash it on the code base to see what can be done...</p>
