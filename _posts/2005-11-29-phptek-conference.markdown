<h2>title: php|tek conference</h2>

<p>I'm an avid reader of <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect magazine</a> and had a blast when attending their conference back in September here in Toronto.  Well, they've announced their next conference, <a href="http://www.phparch.com/tek/index.php">php|tek</a>, which will be taking place in Orlando at the end of April.</p>

<p>I decided to submit a proposal to give a talk called "Scaling for n00bs", where I would give a lecture about some of the things I learned while working on the adult dating site I helped build.  I should find out at the end of December if they like the proposal or not.</p>
