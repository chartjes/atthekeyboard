<h2>title: Preview of "Refactoring Legacy Applications using CakePHP"</h2>

<p>Some of you may know that I have started writing a e-book about CakePHP.  I'm planning on publishing it myself for the low, low price of $7.  I thought I'd let people take a sneak peek at how it looks so far by publishing the first two chapters in very rough form.

As always, give me your feedback on what you see and I will try and make it the best little book on using CakePHP that I can.
