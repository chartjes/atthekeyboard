<h2>title: Simple Testing with PHP</h2>

<p>I'm a guy who believes in the value of agile software development.  My former employers never seemed to quite grasp the concept fully.  My <a href="http://www.sexsearch.com">old project</a> started off agile, but it became a strictly big-design-up-front-all-decisions-from-the-top when things came to a head.  Now, they've gotten even more process intensive and I don't think I could be really productive in that sort of environment at this point in my career.</p>

<p>Anyhow, one of the smart things that we did was create unit tests for just about every single function we had.  We used the <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">SimpleTest</a> unit testing framework.  It works well, can produce output for both web browser and command line stuff.  I'm not sure if they are still using it.</p>

<p>As my interest in PHP security has grown, I started reading Chris Shiflett's <a href="http://shiflett.org">blog</a> and he had some great info on <a href="http://brainbulb.com/agile-php-testing.pdf">Agile Testing</a> with <a href="http://shiflett.org/code/test-more.php">test-more.php</a>, a PHP port of a Perl testing package called (oddly enough) Test::More.  It uses something called TAP (Test Anything Protocol).</p>

<p>Check out the site, check out the PDF, and you will see how easy it can be to implement testing for your PHP applications.</p>
