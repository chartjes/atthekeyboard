<h2>title: \"You've gotten HAML in my Django templates!\" -- Introducing djaml</h2>

<p>
I know I'm such a big nerd, but I'm excited because I've created my first open-source project and put it up on github.  I've been fooling around with Django for quite a while, and I was looking at some independent tools that might help speed up development time.  That lead me to take a look at <a href="http://haml-lang.com">HAML</a>, which in turn led me to <a href="https://github.com/jessemiller/HamlPy/">HamlPy</a>, which then led me to say "Now wouldn't it be cool to use HAML in Django..."
</p>

<p>
After digging around in the Django docs, and a bunch of DuckDuckGo searches later, I found <a href="http://bitbucket.org/jiaaro/django-shpaml-template-loader">this project</a> which showed me how to create my own template loader.  Add a few hours of reading and testing, <a href="https://github.com/chartjes/djaml">djaml</a> was born.
</p>

<p>
So go check the project out, fork it, use it in your own projects.
