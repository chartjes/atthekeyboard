title: Why Being An Optimist Sometimes Pays Off

<p>My lovely wife can tell you that I am of the optimist persuasion, confident that Fate has dealt me a good hand and that any problems I encounter will always turn out in my favour given enough time.  Here is such an example.</p>

<p>Back at the beginning of December, end of November, there was a call put out for papers for the <a href='http://www.phparch.com/tek/'>php|tek</a> convention going on in Orlando, FLA in April.  Alas, my submission was not accepted so I won't be going.  Which sucks.</p>

<p>However, I did receive an e-mail from them saying (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""we got your submission, it didn't fit into what we needed but we think it could make a great article for the magazine."  So, they sent me some documents (tips on how to write for them and a template for creating an article) and asked me to do up a 5 or 6 paragraph summary of a potential article for them.  If they like it, then I'll go full bore and write the article for them.</p>

<p>Way cool, I tell you.</p>

<p>Chalk up another victory for Fate.</p>
