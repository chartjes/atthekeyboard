<h2>title: Quick Hits</h2>

<p>Just a selection of quick hits due to me being behind on this post</p>

<ul>
<li>got the go-ahead on my article for php|architect magazine</li>
<li>struggling with implementing a sortable grid using CakePHP and AJAX (but I'll tame that sucker yet)</li>
<li>wondering if there is a better way to teach the girls I'm coaching to hit a baseball, or is it simply all about hand-eye coordination</li>
<li>complaining that I can't watch my beloved Blue Jays because they are on a west coast road-trip</li>
<li>trying to figure out what to do with my new domain rallyhat.com</li>.
</ul>
