<h2>title: My PHP Article Is Out!</h2>

<p>With no warning (and little fanfare) I found out that my article entitiled "Building Scalable PHP Applications" came out today in the latest issue of <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a> magazine.  I have to say it looks pretty good (very little editing on their part, except for the crappy diagrams I made being correctly not included).</p>

<p>I expect a flurry of comments that I don't know what the heck I'm talking about...</p>
