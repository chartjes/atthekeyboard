<p>Yeah, yeah, I know it's a cliche but you do have to start somewhere.  Some of you searching around on the web may have found my other blog <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/attheballpark">@TheBallPark</a>, where I talk about my experiences with my simulation baseball team.  However, I decided to start up @TheKeyboard to talk about the other side of my life, where I'm a programmer who's working with PHP at his day job and learning Rails on the side.</p>

<p>Again, I need some time to modify this blog as I learn how Serendipity likes to do things.</p>

<p>So, what about my day job?  Well, I work for a company called Instaclick and we do adult dating sites (no names just quite yet, you inquisitive little monkeys).  I spend my days working with PHP code and MySQL databases.  We started out quite small but now we're up to 18 developers, with 4 more on the way.  You may think that's a lot of developers to deal with one web site, but it's a pretty massive code base of 300,000 lines of code.</p>

<p>Anyway, today I got some great news.  Two weeks ago I had attended the php|works conference in Toronto and took the Zend PHP Certification test.  It was a brutal test of 70 questions that cover EVERYTHING in PHP.  In all honesty, if you work with PHP on a regular basis and study a little bit to cover the things you haven't worked much with, you should be able to pass the test.  But you really need a broad knowledge of the language.</p>

<p>You can check out my entry on Zend's web site <a href="http://zend.com/zce.php?c=ZEND901167&amp;r=0910099">here</a></p>

title: Supersecret project is revealed</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>Back when I was at the php|works conference, i hooked up for dinner with <a href="http://www.slash7.com">Amy Hoy</a>, who I had met on the #rubyonrails IRC channel.  My other <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/attheballpark">blog</a> uses <a href="http://www.rubyonrails">Ruby on Rails</a> as the underlying technology.  Anyhow, at the time she mentioned there was a supersecret project she had been working on that she couldn't talk about.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I read about <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a>, a site that lets you build what they call "community and social software" applications really easily.  It looks like they host everything for you, and profide an API (PHP only for now) for you to write your own stuff.  Very interesting concept, and I signed up for a beta developer account if only to screw around with it and see what's going on.</p>

<p>When I saw that Amy's <a href="http://www.omniti.com">employer</a> was helping them out, I put one and one together and figured out that this was the project Amy had mentioned.  Congrats to Amy on being involved in something that is very cool (and sure to spawn imitators).</p>

<p>I also chuckled when I saw that they claim you could create your own <a href="http://dating.ning.com">dating site</a>.  C'mon guys, that's sort of half-true.  The site I work on is sitting at 300K+ lines of code.  Maybe that could be ruthlessly cut down to half via refactoring and rewriting, but that is still a lot of code to maintain.  Simple dating site?  Sure.  Money-making dating site?  Can't see it happening the way Ning is currently setup.  Not to say that it couldn't change because, after all, it's still in beta.</p>

<p>Given that Ning is free (and premium stuff is coming that you'll obviously have to pay for) it might be tough to hack together something that you could make money off of.  Hrm...sounds like an interesting programming challenge...</p>

title: Year of Confusion?
author: Chris Hartjes</p>

<h2>date: 2005-10-05</h2>

<p>There's a <a href="http://blogs.phparch.com/mt/?p=106">posting</a> over at Marco Tabini's weblog where he talks about the rough year that he thinks PHP is facing.  It's all related to the PHP 4 to PHP 5 migration that is going on.  And how many people aren't doing it.  Go read it.</p>

<p>As for me, well, I'm running PHP 5.0.4 right now on my laptop and I'm pushing my host to upgrade to PHP 5 as well.  Work is contemplating making the move, and it wouldn't require very much work at all on our port to make the necessary changes to our code base to take advantage of PHP 5's new features (which are a lot more than "better support for objects".</p>
