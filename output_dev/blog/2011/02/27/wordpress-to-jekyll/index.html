            <p><em>(I would like to apologize for blasting all my RSS readers with EVERY SINGLE POST on this blog when I set things up. The new template for the feed is different and I guess it forced changes on everyone. I didn't intend to do it that way, and I'm sorry for any problems it causes my readers)</em></p>

<p>I've been using WordPress for a long time. It's served up 5+ years
of blog content with very few problems. But with each release of
WordPress, I find myself asking the question "is it worth dragging
all this extra functionality around with me?" I've come to the
conclusion that the answer is no.</p>

<p>Code generation is a programming technique that I think is both
unappreciated and under-utilized by programmers. Naturally, when I
started looking into turning my blog into static pages (I feel like
it's a really good fit for what I'm doing) I looked at solutions in
both Python and Ruby. In the end, I settled on
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>Then I headed to my
<a href="http://duckduckgo.com">favourite search engine</a> and looked for
examples of how to convert a WordPress blog into a Jekyll blog. I
ended up finding this
<a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll">awesome blog post by Paul Stamatiou</a>
that provided me with pretty much all the information I needed. His
"here's all the things I wanted to do and how I achieved them"
worked out really well for me. I even used his
<a href="https://github.com/stammy/jekyll">own fork of Jekyll</a> to build the
new version of this blog. If you follow his instructions and
advice, I don't think you can go wrong.</p>

<p>Not everything went 100% smoothly of course. I had to tweak things
because I was running my blog out of a subdirectory instead of out
of the root. That meant I had to pay attention to the value for
base&#95;url in the Jekyll configuration file, and I also had to be
careful of what I put in my Nginx configuration.</p>

<p>The big changes were to the WordPress migration tool that was
provided. I hacked it to automatically add a header to the post and
to also play with the
<a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/yaml-front-matter">YAML Front Matter</a>
details inside each post. I had decided to use
<a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> for my comments and it took me a while
to figure out how to provide the proper reference values for the
Disqus javascript to find the comments since they had originally
been imported via a WordPress plugin.</p>

<p>I also had to deal with needing to change how syntax highlighting
worked. I had been using a plugin that supported
<a href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/">GeSHi</a> but Jekyll has support
out-of-the box for using <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a>, a
Python-based syntax highlighter. Armed with a little Perl one-liner
skills I quickly search-and-replaced all the old syntax
highlighting tags with the new pairs that I needed.</p>

<p>Now, my blog sits on my laptop and I edit the posts in Vim. When
I'm ready to check things out, I get jekyll to generate the blog
pages for me and I check them out using the local development
server. When I'm happy, I then fire up the deploy shell script that
I use (which runs jekuyll and then uses rsync to push the files up
to my blog) and BOOM I'm done.</p>

<p>I'll be keeping an eye out for any weirdness with the blog and I
hope to make some subtle changes going forward. Doing it as a
static site means I can experiment with the layout from
time-to-time like
<a href="http://blog.peepcode.com/tutorials/2010/about-this-blog">PeepCode has done</a>.
It's always good to learn new skills, and now I can add "static
page generation" to the toolkit.</p>
