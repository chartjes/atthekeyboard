<h2>title: Database Metaprogramming</h2>

<p>
In the absence of anything really pressing to talk about, I thought I'd share two tidbits I found via my feed reader.
</p>

<p>
J. Scott Johnson had a great post at his blog about <a href="http://fuzzyblog.com/archives/2006/08/12/sql_calc_found_rows-and-faster-count-alternatives/">SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS and Faster Count(*) Alternatives</a>.  If you've ever had to write some code that loops through a database searching for counts that match specific where clauses, then go and read this posting.  It just makes so much sense and I had always suspected there was a better way to do the old "query once to get the data you want and then query again to get the count that matches that data" trick.  I must get my SQL skills boosted up one of these days.
</p>

<p>The second posting is from Josh Susser where he talks about <a href=http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/articles/2006/08/13/how-dynamic-finders-work>how ActiveRecord's dynamic finders work</a>.  For those not wiling to go through the archives, ActiveRecord is an Object Relational Mapping wrapper for database connections that makes using databases in your Rails code insanely easy.  <a href="http://www.cakephp.org>CakePHP</a> has it's own ORM stuff and I've been thinking about trying to find a way to expand the findByFoo to be able to handle findByFooAndBar, which it currently does not support.
</p>

<p>I know this is a posting for hardcore programmer geeks, but even if you're mildly interested I suggest you check both those posts out.</p>

<h2>title: Socket Servers Redux</h2>

<p>
It's always nice to beat a deadline at work, and I beat one by 2 hours for getting the alpha version of my <a href=http://www.pa-sportsticker.com/en/index.html>Sportsticker</a> XML stream parser done.  Looking back, I wasted a lot of time on a complicated procedure for parsing the stream when I should've kept it simple.  Luckily, I set it aside for a few hours on Wednesday and then spent Thursday looking for a simpler way to do it.  I found another example on <a href="http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/Socket-Programming-With-PHP/">creating socket servers over at DevShed</a> and that did the trick.  Here's the quick algorithm for what I did.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Read in the stream one line at a time</li>
<li>If the current line is the start of a properly-formed XML block then grab what we've buffered and pass it to SimpleXML, then clear the buffer and start processing the string</li>
<li>If it's not the start of a properly-formed XML block then keep adding the data to the buffer</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Once I've got the XML, I parse through it and check the attributes to see if I've got the data I'm actually looking for, which is baseball boxscores from the AL and the NL.  I'll post the code early next week as I can't access if from home, cleaned up and free of any info that would compromise the company.  I take the info from the XML document (again, I can't say enough about how easy SimpleXML makes these things) and store them in a database. </p>

<p>The second part of the system are two scripts that spit out XML info based on the stuff I've stored in the database, and another developer at work is creating a Flash component that will read in that XML and display the info on our forum sites.  Should be very slick stuff.</p>

<h2>title: Quick Hits</h2>

<p>Here's a short list of some of the things I've been thinking about</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding in code to the stats system at work to collect raw and unique IP addresses.  The twist?  I'm creating it as a plugin for vBulletin</li>
<li>Doing some rework on my <a href="http://hades.phparch.com/ceres/public/page/index.php/works::schedule::synopses::what_can_php_learn_from_rails">session at php|works</a> by reorganizing the content of the talk.  I've listened to a few podcasts lately that have given me some more insight into making this a cool talk</li>
<li>I have a domain name -- rallyhat.com -- that I'm trying to figure out what to do with</li>
<li>I highly recommend that you go and read Scott Johnson's excellent <a href="http://www.fuzzyblog.com">Fuzzyblog</a> and listen to his podcasts as well.  Along with listening to <a href="http://podcast.phparch.com">php|architect's Pro PHP Podcast</a>
</li></ul>

<p>See y'all on Friday.</p>
