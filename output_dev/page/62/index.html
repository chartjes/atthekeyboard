<h2>title: Welcome To The Lazyweb</h2>

<p>One of the cool side effects of blogging is that my friends and family (Hi <a href="http://www.teachersatrisk.com">Mom</a>!) ask me why I do it and eventually the conversation gets around to me suggesting they give blogging a try.  It's worked out quite well for my mother's blog, and now chalk up another successful blog launch for a buddy of mine.</p>

<p>My friend Kevin Beckford is one of the more interesting programming characters out there.  A freelancer who is willing to live long-term at the RamenTuna Hotel as long as he has no bosses, he and I talk several times a day via IM.  He and I share a lot of common thoughts about progamming.  We differ mainly on our choice of editor as he's a <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> fanatic while I have run back into the comforting arms of <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_ide/">Komodo</a>.  </p>

<p>One thing we do share is a passion for programming and a desire to stay true to practices and techniques that lead to better code being developed.  After lots of me hammering away at him to get those ideas out of his brain and into a blog, he's finally lived up to the challenge and has launched the <a href="http://lazyweb.ca">Lazyweb Construction Company</a>.  His most recent post is about something we've talked about:  <a href="http://lazyweb.ca/past/2007/7/24/a_problem_presented_i_know_very/">creating the API first</a>.</p>

<p>  
I don't know how often he plans to update, but I'll be on his case harassing him to post as often as possible.  All those great ideas don't deserve to live inside his head alone!</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I've been working on an internal application for use at <a href="http://www.cakedevelopment.com">CDC</a> that required me to have what I call "two-headed" authentication.  By this I mean that there were two types of users in the system and while they could access some of the same controllers they could not always access the same actions.  I know what you're saying:  why not have them both use the same model instead of making my life difficult?  A few reasons, one of which was that one type of user was using their email address as the login while the other had a more traditional login name.</p>

<p>
After struggling my way through the Auth component (the API changed while I was starting to use it), and understanding the actual flow that the Auth component uses, I nailed down how to do it.  Using good CDC practices (as in "do it our way you stupid Kanuckistanian!") I started off with putting my Auth stuff into the before filter:
~~~
function beforeFilter() {
        parent::beforeFilter();
               
        $this->Auth->loginAction = 'plugin/users/login';
        $this->Auth->loginRedirect = 'plugin/users/index';
        $this->Auth->fields = array('username' => 'username', 'password' => 'psword');
        
        $this->set('current', $this->action);
        
        if($this->Auth->isAuthorized()) {
            
            $role = $this->Auth->user('role');
            
            if($role) {
                if ($role == 'admin' && strpost($this->action, CAKE_ADMIN) !== false) {
                    $this->Auth->allow($this->action);
                }        
                if ($role == 'admin') {
                    $this->set('adminNavigation', $this->adminNavigation);
                }
                
                $this->set('userNavigation', $this->userNavigation);
            } else {
                $this->set('clientNavigation', $this->clientNavigation);    
            }
            
            $this->set('userRole', $role);
        }
 }
~~~
</p>

<p>
Now, I had an action in a controller where a "client" can view everything but a "user" could only view a specific action.  On top of that any "user" who also had an "admin" role could view any action in that controller.  In that particular controller I had to put in this code:
~~~
function beforeFilter() {
        parent::beforeFilter();
        $this->Auth->userModel = 'Client';
        $this->Auth->loginAction = 'plugin/clients/login';
        $this->Auth->fields = array('username' => 'email', 'password' => 'psword');
        $this->Auth->authorize = 'controller';        
}
~~~
In the latest version of the Auth component (from the bleeding edge of Cake 1.2.x.x) you can tell it to use an action in your controller for authorization.  This is if you're lazy like me and don't want to use the Acl (which has a number of steps you need to go through just to get it up and running) or want something very simple.  So, in the above beforeFilter() we override the parent beforeFilter() settings and tell Auth that we want to use our Client model as the source for verifying login credentials.
</p>

<p>
Now, I mentioned before that I had one action in the controller that could be viewed by the User and one action only.  So, I added in the isAuthorized() method to my controller that I told Auth to look for:
~~~
    function isAuthorized() {
        if ($this->Auth->user('role')) {
            if (strpos($this->action, CAKE_ADMIN) !== false && $this->Auth->user('role') == 'admin') {
                return true;
            }
            
            if ($this->action == 'view') {
                return true;
            }
            
            return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
~~~
I think the code is pretty self-explanatory.
</p>

<p>
Working with the Auth component taught me a lesson about frameworks in general: when you take the time to actually dig into the source code of a framework you will realize just how much work goes into some of the more "magic" functions.  I mean, you tell CakePHP that you want to use the Auth component, set a few parameters and *BAM* it takes care of directing people to your login page and validating login names and passwords (even automatically encrypting passwords upon account creation!) against your specified model.  Why wouldn't you want to use something like that?</p>

<h2>title: "What's In Chris' Brain: August 2007 Edition"</h2>

<p>I have a post coming up later this week on some tips and tricks involving CakePHP best practices I've picked up (and had foisted upon me) but for now it's brain dump time:
<ul>
<li>Can the <a href="http://lazyweb.ca">lazyweb</a> tell me where I can find some cool online crime statistics?  I was at a friend's birthday party last Saturday and he suggested a really cool mashup that people searching for houses would be interested in</li>
<li>I'm back to using Komodo instead of vim because, well, vim just couldn't give me the environment I wanted.  What I need is the "here are the files in your project" hanging off the main editing window, syntax checking when I'm typing away, and then show me what files I changed that are going to be checked back into version control.  Komodo does this.  Vim does not.  Well, at least not the way I want it to.</li>
<li>Is it possible for a single incompetent programmer to cost their employer millions of dollars in lost opportunities without actually breaking anything?  I think a lot of managers would go insane if they actually sat down and tracked how the progress of others was held up by a single person.  That "domino" effect could cost a company a lot of money without them actually realizing it.</li>
<li>Big news out of CakePHP-land is that <a href="http://www.mambo-foundation.org">Mambo</a> will be using CakePHP as the core for the next version of Mambo.  Yet another reason to seriously consider CakePHP, if you haven't already</li>
