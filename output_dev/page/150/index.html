        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I was asked on Twitter today for my thoughts on the topic of whether or not
there are things you should NOT test. Of course, I think that you should
<a href="http://www.littlehart.net/test-all-the-things.jpg">test all the things</a>
but let's be honest in what we're trying to do.</p>

<p>Let's start out with the premise that every single bit of code in your
application. By this I mean we have 100% code coverage for your application.
This is difficult but achievable with lots of tests and proper use of
mock objects.</p>

<p>Even with 100% code coverage, it still might not be enough. So much 
depends on your actual test cases. Have you anticipated edge cases that
could cause your code grief? This is the one area of web applications that
I think leads to the greatest amount of problems: determining edge cases
when your code accepts user-generated content. So even if 100% code coverage
can't save you from every problem, what is a good compromise?</p>

<p>If you obsessively run PHPUnit code coverage reports like I do, you will be familiar
with the <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=210575">CRAP index</a> values
for your code. Go read the article about it. I'll wait.</p>

<p>I think that if you want to do effective testing, you can probably limit
your code coverage efforts to class methods or functions that have a CRAP index
of 5 of more. It's a low enough value that you will end up testing a very large
amount of your application's code base and will be testing non-trivial code.</p>

<p>You don't really need to test pass-through methods or functions (functions that are one-liners
that return the response from another methods or functions) or getter / setter
functions (if you're into that sort of thing). Chances are they will get
coverage in tests that call those methods.</p>

<p>In essence, don't waste a lot of time writing tests that test the trivial
or totally expected. You will have a much greater impact on your application
by writing tests for the complicated parts of your application.</p>

<p>Finally, I encourage you to pursue another very impactful testing practice:
whenever a bug is reported in your application, write a test to verify 
the bug. Then fix your application until the bug goes away. By doing things
that way, you end up with a collection of tests that reflect the various
ways that the users of your application actually, you know, use your
application.</p>

<p>Good code coverage results in a feeling that only weird edge cases are going
to bring your application crashing down. That frees you up to keep on
building out the application instead of worrying if a minor change is going
to wreak everything.</p>

<p>So the ultimate goal is TEST ALL THE THINGS THAT MATTER. Aim for that, and
the rest will all fall into place.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2012/05/15/have-a-strategy">Have A &#039;Strategy&#039;</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Yesterday on Twitter I got into a nerdfight with a blogger who posted a
blog entry about <a href="http://odino.org/use-the-strategy-to-avoid-the-switch-case-antipattern/">using the Strategy pattern to avoid switch-case</a>.
At first glance, I was convinced that he was using <a href="http://ca.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.variable.php">variable variables</a>
which I feel is a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smell</a>.</p>

<p>So natually I started arguing. I was rude. He was rude, slapping me in the twitter face with a blog link that seemed
to indicate he thought I had no idea about variables in PHP. To be fair I earned that by not paying attention.
Once I realized what he was doing, I realized that the Strategy pattern was applicable in this case...but his
chosen example was dumb and one that I wouldn't have used to demonstrate things. As expected, he told me to supply
a sample of a better way. I did, telling him that the sample would be better if he didn't mash the logging level
together with the message.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm not going to do that bit of work here. Instead, I want to show that it is not enough to teach an idea
to someone. You have to show them how to test their idea once it's been refactored to make sure nothing has changed.
First, let's start with a working example of his logging class, using the dreaded switch-case.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

// Sample logger class that uses a switch-case
require_once 'LoggingException.php';

class LoggerSwitch
{
    public function logMessage($message = "CRITICAL::The system encountered a problem")
    {
        $parts = explode('::', $message);
        $level = strtolower($parts[0]);
        $logMessage = $parts[1];

        switch ($level) {
            case 'notice':
                return $this-&gt;_writeToLog($level, $logMessage);
            case 'critical':
                $this-&gt;_writeToLog($level, $logMessage);
                return $this-&gt;_emailOps($message);
            case 'catastrophe':
                $this-&gt;_writeToLog($level, $logMessage);
                $this-&gt;_emailOps($logMessage);
                return $this-&gt;_textCeo($message);
        }

        throw new LoggingException("Unknown logging level {$level}");
    }

    protected function _writeToLog($level, $logMessage)
    {
        return "Wrote {$logMessage} to {$level} file";
    }

    protected function _emailOps($logMessage)
    {
        return "Sent email to Ops";
    }

    protected function _textCeo($message)
    {
        return "Sent text to CEO";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the tests for it</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

// PHPUnit test for logger-switch.php

require '../logger-switch.php';

class LoggerSwitchTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    public $logger;

    public function setUp()
    {
        $this-&gt;logger = new LoggerSwitch();
    }

    /**
     * Data provider for testing our logging object
     */
    public function loggerTestingScenarios() 
    {
        return array(
            array(
                'NOTICE::test notice message',
                'Wrote test notice message to notice file'
            ),
            array(
                'CRITICAL::test notice message',
                'Sent email to Ops'
            ),
            array(
                'CATASTROPHE::test notice message',
                'Sent text to CEO'
            ),
        );
    }

    /**
     * @test
     * @dataProvider loggerTestingScenarios
     * @param $message          string
     * @param $expectedResponse string
     */
    public function testReturnsExpectedResponseBasedOnMessage(
        $message,
        $expectedResponse)
    {
        $response = $this-&gt;logger-&gt;logMessage($message);
        $this-&gt;assertEquals(
            $expectedResponse,
            $response,
            'Did not get expected response'
        );
    }

    /**
     * @test
     */ 
    public function testThrowsExceptionWhenUnknownLevelSubmitted()
    {
        $this-&gt;setExpectedException('LoggingException', 'Unknown logging level test');
        $response = $this-&gt;logger-&gt;logMessage('TEST:: test message');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>These tests give us 100% test coverage, in case you were wondering.</p>

<p>Okay, so the next step is to refactor our incredibly stupid logging class to
use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy pattern</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

// Logging class that uses the strategy pattern
require_once 'LoggingException.php';

class LoggerStrategy
{
    public function logMessage($message = "CRITICAL::The system encountered a problem")
    {
        $parts = explode('::', $message);
        $level = strtolower($parts[0]);
        $method = sprintf('_log%sMessage', ucfirst($level));

        if (!method_exists($this, $method)) {
            throw new LoggingException('Unknown logging level ' . $level);
        }

        return $this-&gt;$method($parts[1]);
    }   

    protected function _logNoticeMessage($message)
    {
        return $this-&gt;_writeToLog('notice', $message);
    }

    protected function _logCriticalMessage($message)
    {
        $this-&gt;_writeToLog('critical', $message);
        return $this-&gt;_emailOps($message);  
    }

    protected function _logCatastropheMessage($message)
    {
        $this-&gt;_writeToLog('catastrophe', $message);
        $this-&gt;_emailOps($message);
        return $this-&gt;_textCeo($message);
    }

    protected function _writeToLog($level, $logMessage)
    {
        return "Wrote {$logMessage} to {$level} file";
    }

    protected function _emailOps($logMessage)
    {
        return "Sent email to Ops";
    }

    protected function _textCeo($message)
    {
        return "Sent text to CEO";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The thing that lept out at me was that this refactor worked, but resulted in
more code. The good characteristic is all the small methods without lots of
code in them. Even better is that we don't have to change any of our tests,
everything worked the same! All we had to do was change which object we
were using for $this->logger.</p>

<p>If you want to see the code for this blog post for yourself (it does work
and run using PHPUnit) you can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/chartjes/blog-strategy">Github</a>.

as proof that I did cover everything I should have.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>In the run-up to <a href="http://tek.phparch.com">php|tek 2012</a> next week I wanted to
do a blog entry every day this week. Since I am supremely lazy I made sure to
ask my followers on Twitter what they would like me to blog about. There were
some interesting suggestions but I will start out with one that I think
explains a lot about me.</p>

<p>I've spent quite a bit of time in the last few years helping to spread the word
that having automated test suites and testable applications is a good thing.
I know it's not easy and I've had conversations with many other developers who
still think that writing tests is a waste of time, not appropriate for their
unique situation, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>If I were to make some sweeping generalizations about those people who feel
that test-driven development is a waste of time, I would call them supremely
overconfident in their own abilities in the face of plenty of evidence that
suggests otherwise. Many developers that I respect immensely still seem to
think that Getting Shit Done Does Not Include Writing Tests.</p>

<p>I will return to that topic later.</p>

<p>I don't remember when it was that I exactly discovered <a href="http://simpletest.org">SimpleTest</a> while
working at an online dating site. I do remember it was in 2003. If I had to make an educated guess it was
because I had gotten tired of testing everything through a browser. Loading
the same pages OVER AND OVER AND OVER again, hoping I had covered all the
scenarios for the incredibly crummy code I was writing (this was quite early
in my programming career) in my manual testing. Only to find that I had 
missed something and it was causing problems on the live site.</p>

<p>Once I discovered unit testing, it was like a bit was flipped in my brain.
I immediately understood the benefits of a test suite that we could run from
the browser AND provide proof that all was good. No more manual testing unless 
absolutely necessary!</p>

<p>It took some time and some lobbying but not too long before I left, the
application architect they had hired decided that we needed to write a bunch
of tests using SimpleTest as part of progressing towards a refactoring and
rewrite of the application itself, since it really was the type of spaghetti
PHP application the language is derided for encouraging.</p>

<p>I don't know what happened to all those tests after I left. I would keep
running into people who I worked with there and new hires and would sometimes
ask what was going on. Never did ask about tests though, as I assumed that
they were either still there but not being used, or ripped out under the
guise of Getting Shit Done Does Not Include Writing Tests.</p>

<p>So why am I still in the minority that values testing? I think it's because
many people blind themselves to the reality of how much work they are really
getting done. Writing tests as part of the development process, in my opinion,
simply moves the debugging of your application from after you've written the
code to while you are still writing it.</p>

<p>Look, it still takes the same amount of time to write code + debug whether you
use TDD or GSDDNIWT. Be honest with yourself. Every time you are up until the
early hours of the morning trying to fix a problem is an opportunity to be
really honest with yourself and say "how can I avoid this?" instead of saying
"oh well, this is how it really is." I believe that having tests will reduce
the amount of time you spend trying to understand why things are not working 
the way that you expect them to.</p>

<p>If anything, the rise of startup worship makes the job of people like me
even tougher. Minimum Viable Product goes hand-in-hand with GSDDNIWT. I cringe
when people forward me conversations with their bosses and co-workers that
seem to imply that only inexperienced developers really need tests. "Rockstars
have the codebase memorized and can intuitively make changes that won't break
anything." Really?</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself, but testing is my way of not having to remember
the entire code base. It lets me examine discrete modules of code and see
clear examples of how they work and how they are supposed to interact with
other modules. When it's crunch time and something absolutely needs to work,
my memory is the last thing I want to be relying on to tell me where to look
for the problem.</p>

<p>I could write a very long ranty blog post about testing but I will save my
energy for those ready to be converted instead of those who have decided to
rely on their immense programming skills and eidetic memory about their
application. Lesser mortals like me will knit themselves a comfy blanket
using tests and simplified application models and hopefully be sound asleep
while my rockstar compatriots are up at 2am debugging their application 
after a painful production launch.</p>
