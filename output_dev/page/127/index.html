<h2>title: "People Who Make Me Feel Stupid: Fabien Potencier"</h2>

<p><i>This is the final in a series of blog posts about programmers who make me feel stupid due to the amazing work they've done and their ability to explain it.  Check out my thoughts on <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/01/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-geoffrey-grosenbach/">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a>, <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/02/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-antirez/">Antirez</a>, <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/03/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-rich-hickey/">Rich Hickey</a> and <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2010/03/04/people-who-make-me-feel-stupid-ezra-zygmuntowicz/">Ezra Zygmuntowicz.</a></i></p>

<p>I am, for lack of a better phrase, a framework whore.  I use frameworks to build all my web applications.  Why?  Because I prefer to stand on the shoulder of giants rather than constantly reinvent things.  But in many ways, my addiction to frameworks is counter-productive because I find myself constantly wanting to use a new one.  So I end up churning instead of pushing forwards.   I've been learning Zend Framework, and I'm struggling.  Too many ways to do things, too much documentation that provides me with a tease of what it is I'm trying to do but not the full solution.  Then I have to ask people for help and feel stupid for not being the Rock Star Developer(tm) with all the answers.  
</p>

<p>
So, even though I use Zend Framework now (unless I change my mind, get pissed off and go with the <a href="http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/38-The-no-framework-PHP-MVC-framework.html">no-framework framework</a>) I do watch other frameworks.  While I might not agree with some features of <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">Symfony</a>, I am astounded at what <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org/">Fabien Potencier</a> continues to produce.
</p>

<p>
Creating a framework is an achievement in itself.  Creating a framework in a language as your first real PHP project, like Fabien did, is nothing short of amazing.  Symfony is a full-stack framework, the kind of comfy and warm blanket I like to use when building an application on a short timeline.  Like many other full-stack frameworks, they also wrote stuff that other people had already written.  It's a common thing, everyone goes through the "not invented here" phase.  Sometimes, that's the only way you learn how to do something.
</p>

<p>
But as Symfony glides smoothly along towards a 2.0 release, imagine the shock of people when they see Fabien talk about how he is going to use parts of Zend Framework in the 2.0 core and dump existing components like their own unit-testing framework in favour of PHPUnit.
</p>

<p>
In the blog post about <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2010/03/04/symfony-2-0-and-the-php-ecosystem">decisions about Symfony 2</a>, he mentions the logic surrounding what appears to be a new public philosophy from Symfony: "Use what's out there; realise it sucks; write your own; wait until others suck less; dump your own; use other."
</p>

<p>
This is a very refreshing stance for the guiding power of a popular web application framework to take.  It reminds me of when Rails and Merb decided to quit fighting and instead become the same project in Rails 3.  The hater in me thinks that it's because Merb was becoming what Rails wanted to be, so kudos to the effort to rework Rails to make it better.  After all, that's the goal -- to produce better, faster software.
</p>

<p>
So why does Fabien make me feel stupid:  <b>His constant willingness to do the right thing for his project, even if it means tossing away stuff that spent a long time working on.</b>  Again, just like all the others I've talked about here, he does an amazing job of explaining what he did in a way that makes it obvious.  His thoughts on <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org/article/11/what-is-dependency-injection">dependency injection</a> helped me to understand why it's important to consider it when building your applications.  I've written code that uses it and code that does not.  I found it easier to refactor code when I used dependency injection, but that just might be me.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for following this series this week.  I hoped I've exposed you to some people you might not have heard of or known about their work.

<h2>title: Rallyhat lives!</h2>

<p>
Some of my long-time readers have seen me mention a long-festering (I believe that is the correct term at this point) project that I dubbed <a href="http://www.rallyhat.com">Rallyhat</a>.  It first started out as a "figure out when some baseball teams are in town and buy tickets" and then morphed into "a tool for helping people plan road trips by tagging destinations with information".
</p>

<p>
What it really became was a tool for me to learn how to write a solid web-app using Python and Django.  I'm happy to say I finally have a version that I feel comfortable sharing with the rest of you.  So feel free to check it out.  Pound on it, try and break it and I will also read your feedback and comments.  I'm sure you can figure out my email address...
</p>

<p>
Also, I've found it has been easy to pick up not only Python and Django itself.  I'm ready to tackle some other applications using Django, and I have one just in mind.  
</p>

<p>
Yes, I am aware at how spartan it looks right now.  I'm more focussed on functionality than how it looks right now.  I've already gotten some interesting ideas on expanding the app to include adding in images to go with locations, so we'll see how that goes.
</p>

<p>
For those who are curious, I built it using the following:
<ul>
<li>Python 2.6</li>
<li>Django 1.2 beta 1</li>
<li><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> to store the trip plans</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/couchdb-python/">couchdb-python</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/geopy/">GeoPy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/">django-registration</a></li>
<li>Google Maps services</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar">Django Debug Toolbar</a></li>
<li>deployed using Nginx + <a href="http://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn">Gunicorn</a>, configured with the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/ericlo">Eric Florenzano's</a> awesome Django Advent article about <a href="http://djangoadvent.com/1.2/deploying-django-site-using-fastcgi/">deploying Django using FastCGI</a> because it mentioned how you could use Gunicorn</li>
</ul>

<h2>title: "Expand your programming mind:  filters in Lithium"</h2>

<p>Out of the ashes of a severe personality clash in an <a href="http://cakephp.org">open source PHP web application framework project</a> rose a new framework proclaiming that it <a href="http://rad-dev.org/lithium/wiki">simply sucks less than all the others</a>.  Lithium, otherwise known as li3, is the latest PHP application framework to come onto the scene.  I know what you're saying.  *Yawn*.
</p>

<p>
As far as I can tell, Lithium is trying it's hardest to be fast, lightweight, and use all the features that PHP 5.3 has to offer.  I am unable to use it at work for a variety of reasons (not stable, required PHP 5.3 only, <a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele">Nate</a> is always picking on me via IM) but I am more interested in the ideas that are coming out of it.
</p>

<p>
It is using all the newest hawtness in the PHP world:  namespaces, closures, Phar, late static binding.  I could go on, but probably most of these things mean nothing to you until you actually need them.  In the framework world, namespaces are a big deal, an essential tool to avoiding collisions with 3rd party code you might want to integrate into your project.  Closures are very familiar to those who've done work with Ruby or Javascript.  Phar allows for some unarchiving on the fly of code, even potentially distributing your application as an archive that can be run.  Late static binding is something I'm trying to comes to grips with, as I have either never come across a need for it or never realized that I did and have implemented a workaround for it not realizing there is a simpler solution.
</p>

<p>
None of these are what I want to talk about.  I want to talk about something that I feel is a very underrated part of Lithium, the ability to define filters.  This is a concept that you find in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">Aspect-oriented programming</a>, and one that I imagine most programmers have never considered.  Here's why I think it's a big deal.
</p>

<p>
Most frameworks are designed around an OOP paradigm.  Yes, some mix them together (I'm looking at *you* CodeIgniter), but by and large you get the job done by extending on a base model / controller / helper / whatever to create new functionality.  Sometimes this is not avoidable.  But what AOP says is that there is another way, a way that Lithium has adopted as well.
</p>

<p>
Hence the creation of "filters".  As far as I can tell (and I'm sure I will be jumped upon if I am wrong) the purpose of filters in Lithium is to allow you to add functionality without extending the class itself.  When I saw that I immediately understood why that is so awesome.
</p>

<p>
The idea of callbacks is also very similar:  if X happens, run code Y.  A staple of jQuery, Rails and probably other projects I have forgotten to mention.  The idea is still the same though.  In Garrett Woodworth's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gwoo/li3-ocphp">presentation about Lithium to the Orange County PHP Users Group</a> he goes  over some solid examples of filters including:
<ul>
<li>automatic use of the <a href="http://mirror.facebook.net/facebook/xhprof/doc.html">XHProf</a> for code profiling</li>
<li>automatic setting of parameters upon saving a pasted bit of code</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>It's also been used to <a href="http://misja.posterous.com/playing-with-lithium">automatically change string record ID's into a MongoDB ID</a> and <a href="http://latestatic.com/integration-testing-or-how-i-learned-to-stop">graceful failing of an integration test suite when an error occurs</a>.
</p>

<p>
These filters remind me of behaviors in Rails (and in CakePHP as well) and makes me wonder if signals are the same thing in the Django world.  All in all, this looks to me to be a better way to extend functionality than actually overriding existing methods or hacking at something deep inside a class.  Figure out what functionality you want, figure out where it needs to be called, and add your filter.
