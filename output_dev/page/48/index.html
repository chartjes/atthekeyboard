<h2>title: Back from Vancouver PHP Conference 2007</h2>

<p>Looks like I just missed a winter storm that is currently pounding the Greater Toronto Area (Milton is on the outskirts of the GTA) so I may actually be snowed in tomorrow.  Good thing I can work from home when necessary.</p>

<p>
I had a good time in Vancouver at the <a href="http://vancouver.php.net/php_conference">conference</a>, although I really wished I could've stayed for the second day.  I want to thank Shane, Audrey, Peter and all the other organizers for giving me first-class treatment (Audrey, I still owe you that drink).  My talk was really well-attended (much to my surprise as I was up against Ilia and Derek) and I was far less nervous about it than I was when I gave this talk.</p>

<p>I have to thank some of the following speakers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gravatonic.com">Andrei</a> for putting up with me, trying to push me to eat that enormous plate of nachos, and for pointing me in the direction of the <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/">Xbox Media Center</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.phpdoc.info">Sean</a> for straightening out some issues surrounding getting paid for a magazine article</li>
<li><a href="http://www.preinheimer.com/">Paul</a> for being in good spirits despite being deathly ill (and being cool about me grabbing a menu from you like an idiot)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'll be seeing most of these same people in Chicago at php|tek, so that's yet another reason to look forward to the middle of May.  Anyhow, I managed to make a screencast of my talk and chopped it down to size for the blog.  Hope you enjoy it!
</p>

<h2>title: Interview with Cal Evans</h2>

<p>Back in September when I was at php|works I did an <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/1701">interview</a> with Cal Evans, the editor of Zend's Dev Zone.  We chatted for about 30 minutes about various topics (we have similar introductions to the world of computers) but he had to cut it off there.  We had even more interesting discussions during the course of the conference, but a lot of those will have to stay buried for the time being...

<h2>title: What's Chris Thinking About, February Edition</h2>

<p>My apologies for the lateness (and shortness) of this post.  Real life has intruded this week.  More news on this later.  But here's what's jumping around in my brain:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cake.insertdesignhere.com/">Nate</a> from CakePHP is helping me out with the work on my proposal for an interactive console.  Trax (a Cake "competitor") has an interactive shell so I'm taking a look at how they are doing things to see what I can use from it.  Thank you open source licensing!</li>
<li>There has been great feedback from those who watched the screencast of my talk from Vancouver and I'm going to tweak the talk for May.  Remove some slides, avoid duplication and build up the parts that drew a lot of interest:  deployment and programmer ego.</li>
<li>I'm going to have to dive into the slightly old <a href="http://www.typosphere.org">Typo</a> install and figure out how to stop the huge amounts of trackback spam we've been getting.  Seems that the Typo install I'm running ignores requests to stop accepting trackbacks.  Gotta fix that by hacking at the source</li>
</ul>
