<h2>title: "What's In Chris' Brain: March 2008 Edition"</h2>

<p>I've got a whole bunch of little things I want to talk about, as opposed to one big topic.  Here we go</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>You'll see a badge on the right side of my blog announcing that I'm speaking at <a href="http://openwebvancouver.ca">Open Web Vancounver 2008</a>.  If you can make your way up to Vancouver on April 14th and April 15th, please come up and support this conference.</li>
<li>I got an email from someone on the CakePHP mailing list asking me about what sort of setup I have for running my apps.  I have a 256 MB slice <a href="http://www.slicehost.com">with slicehost</a>, and I have ZERO complaints about performance.  I'm running PHP 5.2.5 under fastcgi (I use nginx as my web server), with MySQL on there to power my blog.  In an earlier post I wrote how to create the rewrite rules for CakePHP to work with nginx, so search my archives for that.  I've got Python on there as well for my upcoming Django work, and soon Apache will be on there to act as my app server for Django.
</li>
<li>Wrote my first Python script for work:  it trolls through a bunch of gzipped XML documents, doing some search and replace.  75 lines of pure Python n00bness, built entirely with the help of "Dive Into Python" and google.  I'm sure it could be optimized by some more experienced Pythonistas, but it sure felt good to get the first one done and out of the way.</li>
<li>I've decided to start using <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> again, see how long that lasts</li>
<li>The more I use it, the more powerful I realize jQuery is</li>
<li>Some ruthless refactoring has caused my Code Igniter code to be a bit more CakePHP-like, in that I'm moving stuff into models and out of the controller wherever it makes sense.  That's a good practice no matter what framework you use</li>
<li>As much info as there is out there for using Django (the Django project site, the Django book available online), it sure would be helpful to me to find some sort of Django guru who can help me out with some of the finer points of Django and Python itself.  I'm trying very hard to not write Python code like I was writing PHP, and I feel like some of the finer points are escaping me.</li>
<li>I'm working on moving some old CakePHP code I have that runs on PHP 4 over to PHP 5, and having PHP 4 *and* PHP 5 running on the same server.  Should be an interesting experience</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>title: Upcoming Git Book</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com">Travis Swicegood</a>, who is now my DBFF (Django Best Friend Forever) is writing a book about <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> entitled <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/03/23/pragmatic-version-control-using-git">Pragmaatic Version Control Using Git</a>.  Nicely done, Travis!</p>

<p>
As someone who has started using git not too long ago, I completely agree with him that the market for such a book is wide open.  Hurry up and get it done!</p>

<h2>title: Deployment Horror Stories</h2>

<p>I was going to do a rant today in honour of April Fools' day, talking about how much it frustrates me to no end that people prefer complicated explanations for their bugs:
<blockquote>
Them: "I notice that module X is no longer working when I moved from BloatOS to TinyNX, and my framistat widget is now displaying stars instead of being in plain-text.  Why is the component doing that?"
Me: "Dude, that component doesn't just magically stop working because you're on TinyNX.  Are you using the same version of FooWorks in both environments?"
Them: "I think so."
Me: "Don't f*****g THINK so, MAKE SURE".
Them "But it was working just fine..."
Me:  "SILENCE!  I'll bet you the balance in my savings account that you are using the star framistat widget on TinyNX and the two code bases aren't the same"
Them: "Oh, will you look at that...somehow an older intermediate version of the code using the star widget was deployed on the TinyNX version"
Me: "You owe me lunch"
</blockquote>
People, people, people.  Weird problems almost ALWAYS have a simple solution.  But enough about how smart I think I am, back on topic.
</p>

<p>
I've started working on my presentation I'm giving in two weeks.  Oh, don't worry, I know what I'm going to say but I just need to create the slides that results from it.  Part of the presentation is pointing out some deployment horror stories and how they could've been avoided.  If you can swallow your pride and share some of those stories with me, I'd appreciate it.  I will start off with one of my own.
</p>

<p>
Back when I used to work for an adult dating website, we built a database abstraction class that passed all data modification statements to our master database server...via HTTP.  Yes, we wrote code that listened for a string to be sent to it and then executed the code on the server.  I don't have the time or the patience to explain how this decision was made, but there it was.  We were lead to believe that MySQL replication at the time (this is 5 years ago) was in 'milliseconds' so we thought we were okay dealing with the very large number of updates that would happen to the master, and then being replicated to the 7 to 8 application servers we had running at the time.
</p>

<p>
That was until we found out that replication is slow, and some machines were up to 30 minutes behind on processing the replication requests.  Holy shit.
</p>

<p>
The solution was to decide what requests could be done later, and creating a queuing system for processing those delayed requests.  Apparently this same system is in place today, despite the current software architect's desire for switching things to a clustering or sharding scenario for the data.  Since the site is so dependent on people signing up for paid accounts, nothing is allowed to be done that can disrupt the site when deploying changes.  Best of luck with that.
