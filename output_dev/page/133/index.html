<h2>title: What's in Chris' Brain - October 2010 Edition</h2>

<p>I haven't done one of these for a while, so I thought I'd share some stuff I've been looking at lately.  Also, I'm not doing anything earth-shattering that needs a blog post. ;)</p>

<h3>Stange Loop Conference</h3>

<p>
I found out about this <a href="http://strangeloop2010.com/">conference</a> via Twitter.  I enjoyed St. Louis immensely when the family drove 17 hours to visit my wife's brother and his wife 3 years ago.  The zoo there is awesome and free!  Anyway, there were a lot of interesting talks given using a wide variety of languages and tools.  Nice to see a conference that was focused on what I call the "future shock" technologies:   ones that use paradigms that are very different from the mainstream and trying to show you practical uses for them.  One that stood out was Kyle Simpson's <a href="http://strangeloop2010.com/talks/14469">"Dude, That's some Strange UI Architecture"</a>.  He did a brief demo of a Javascript-powered framework that used what he called Client-View-Controller, where EVERYTHING is Javascript except the black box that is your data source.  The tl;dr version?  Javascript on the client and the server, use <a href="http://github.com/leeoniya/handlebar.js"> for templating, and make sure your data source can accept and return JSON.  Very interesting, and worth checking out.
</a></p>

<h3>Sharding and NoSQL - Be careful!</h3>

<p>
Great blog post on one of my favourite reads, the High Scalability blog, about the problems Foursquare experienced with MongoDB and <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/10/15/troubles-with-sharding-what-can-we-learn-from-the-foursquare.html">what can be learned from it.</a>  Lesson #1 of superhyped technologies:  make sure the damn thing works for what YOU need it to do.  MySQL and Postgres are also great key-value stores.  It's all about understanding your data, not ditching JOINS because someone else told you to.
</p>

<h3>Make an Infoproduct</h3>

<p>
My internet-famous sort-of-friend (meaning we've known each other for a while via the internet and have actually met in person, once, in Toronto) <a href="http://twitter.com/amyhoy">Amy Hoy</a> is hustling her way to piles of cash by sharing the skills she's developed along the way.  Go and read her awesome post on <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2010/make-an-infoproduct/">making digital goods that you can sell.</a>.  Amy catches a lot of flack for her willingness to express her desire to make MONEY from her SKILLS.  Having already done this once myself, to middling success (my <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/book">CakePHP book</a> has done better than I thought it would, but probably not as good as it really could've) I can tell you that Amy knows what she is talking about.  Don't listen to the haters, go and make something you can charge money for!.

<h2>title: "Ask My Readers: Development Environments"</h2>

<p>I thought I'd turn things around a pick and ask my readers for some advice on particular topics.  Today's topic is Development Environments.</p>

<p>
Currently, I run Zend Server Community edition on my laptop to match what we're using in production (except on the new production games platform server, where I am running Nginx + Apache and not using ZSCE) but have been rethinking this for no reason other then "try and make it better."  One thing I have thought of doing is to use virtual machines on my MacBook to accomplish this.  I have Virtualbox, and I use it to test things once in a blue moon on IE7 and IE8.  Given that it takes up a lot of space I have been thinking to either use it or get rid of it.
</p>

<p>
Do any of my readers have experience with doing development work using localized virtual servers?  Keep in mind that I am using <a href="http://www.vim.org">The One True Editor</a> so I would have to be able to edit code in the virtual machine from my laptop (best case) or on the virtual machine (worst case).

<h2>title: What's In Chris' Brain - December 2010 Edition</h2>

<p>Blogger's block is a real thing people -- especially when you feel like you are not accomplishing anything that you can share.  Here are some of the things bouncing around in my brain.</p>

<h3>User Groups</h3>

<p>
I'm giving a talk for the GTA PHP User Group on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GTA-PHP-User-Group-Toronto/calendar/15561375/">Test Driven Development using PHP</a> on December 6th at <a href="http://www.longbranchcoworking.com/">Longbranch Coworking</a>.  If you're in the Greater Toronto Area, I'd love to see you come out and watch me talk about how TDD helps restore my sanity.
</p>

<p>No matter what language you use, you should seek out your local user group if one exists.  Nowhere else will you find people who (a) use the language or tools you are interested in and (b) willing to commit the time to meeting people with similar interests.  I got to meet CakePHP lead developer <a href="http://mark-story.com">Mark Story</a> at the last one, so you never know who might show up.
</p>

<h3>CodeMash 2010</h3>

<p>
I'm super-excited to be speaking at <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash 2011</a> in January 2011.  Even better, the whole family is coming with me so they can play at the ginormous indoor water park at the resort where the conference is being held while I'm geeking out.  I'll be giving a TDD and Continuous Integration talk (don't know what day or what time yet) and I will try and record the talk as a screencast to share with everyone who couldn't make it.  If you don't already have a ticket, you are out of luck as the conference is completely sold out.  In fact, it sold out in just THREE-AND-A-HALF DAYS.  That's incredible.
</p>

<h3>PHP application deployment</h3>

<p>
I've talked before how I used Phing to deploy stuff at work.  It works just fine, but I always found it annoying that I had to connect to a server via SSH to get things done.  I haven't been able to block off a bunch of time to come up with a better solution, but I think someone else has.  The creator of PHP, Rasmus Lerdorf, has open-sourced a <a href="http://dev.wepay.com/blog/2010/11/30/weploy-wepays-deployment-tool/">web-based deployment solution he created for use at WePay</a>.  All the code is available on GitHub.  It suddenly seems more important to me to set aside some time to fix the current deployment situation at work...
</p>

<h3>Books you should check out</h3>

<p>
During my blogging silence I have been reading books and watching presentations and/or reading slides.  Some fiction (I love my sci-fi and historical fiction) but mostly programming-related.  Here is some stuff you should take a look at:
<ul>
<li>"Designing Social Interfaces" by Christian Crumlish & Erin Malone</li>
<li>"Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" by Bruce Tate</li>
<li>Literally *any* presentation by <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/">Christian Heillman</a>, currently an evangelist at Mozilla.  Looking at his presentations flipped some switch in my brain and I'm looking at things totally differently.</li>
<li>All 6 of the Scott Pilgrim books</li>
</ul>
