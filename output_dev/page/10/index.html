<p>I got an e-mail the other day from the folks at <a href="http://www.zend.com">Zend</a> informing me that they were going to be certifying their 1000th person very shortly, and as a thank you for being one of the first 1000 Zend Certified Engineers we were given a special grahpic to put on our web site instead of the usual graphic that they recommended using to signify you are Zend Certified.  So I uploaded it to this site and you can see it in the "About The Blogger" section.</p>

<p>I know some people have poo-pooed the certification, but it got me my current job and recommend that anyone who wants to be taken seriously as a PHP developer write the test.  Don't forget to study though. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" /></p>

title: Why Being An Optimist Sometimes Pays Off
date: 2006-01-18</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>My lovely wife can tell you that I am of the optimist persuasion, confident that Fate has dealt me a good hand and that any problems I encounter will always turn out in my favour given enough time.  Here is such an example.</p>

<p>Back at the beginning of December, end of November, there was a call put out for papers for the <a href='http://www.phparch.com/tek/'>php|tek</a> convention going on in Orlando, FLA in April.  Alas, my submission was not accepted so I won't be going.  Which sucks.</p>

<p>However, I did receive an e-mail from them saying (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""we got your submission, it didn't fit into what we needed but we think it could make a great article for the magazine."  So, they sent me some documents (tips on how to write for them and a template for creating an article) and asked me to do up a 5 or 6 paragraph summary of a potential article for them.  If they like it, then I'll go full bore and write the article for them.</p>

<p>Way cool, I tell you.</p>

<p>Chalk up another victory for Fate.</p>

title: All-time Best Hangovers
date: 2006-01-25</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>I went out for beers with my former work buddies at our <a href="http://www.martiniboys.com/pages/reviews/rhino.htm">usual hangout</a> and a good time was had by all.  This morning I was talking with <a href="http://www.juliansimpson.com">Julian</a> about all-time best hangovers.  Here are my top 3:</p>

<ol>
<li>23rd birthday where I tried to drink 23 rum-and-cokes (it was 1.08 drink night) and made it to 19</li>
<li>My bachelor party (although all the drinking got done in a ridiculously short period of time)</li>
<li>A company Halloween party where it was packed with webmasters and staff, and it was OPEN BAR.  My friend Kris still talks about that party to this day.</li>
</ol>
