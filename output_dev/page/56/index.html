<h2>title: Where Are The Good Development Tools For PHP, Part II</h2>

<p>Thanks to everyone for the great comments to my previous post on this topic.  I think I may have found the answer to what I was looking for.  Cal Evans over at the Zend Developer Zone gave me a heads-up that he would be posting a tutorial on <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/2019">using Flex and PHP</a>.  I believe my exact words to him after about 10 minutes of playing with it was "this is FUCKING cool!".  Which it definitely is.</p>

<p>
Flash at the front, and PHP at the back I think is the sweet spot for me.  I followed his tutorial (which was very well done, kudos to you Cal) and in under ten minutes from having FlexBuilder installed (30 day trial, but FlexBuilder is really expensive at US$499) I had a very simple Flex app that was talking to my Zend Framework-powered PHP application.  I built a very simple playlist editor where I could add and remove items from the playlist.  In invested a grand total of 30 minutes in playing with it.  Big props to Adobe for creating such a cool tool for "rich internet applications".  I was hoping I could catch Mike Potter's talk at php|tek but I don't know if I'll make it in time.  My flight is supposed to touch down at 11:00AM in Chicago and the talk is at 11:30...only a miracle would get me there in time.
</p>

<p>I'm thinking of seeing if I can build a media upload app using Flex on Monday for the supersecret IPTV project I've been working on since I started at Syneron.  Think I can do it?  Cal tells me that there are some open source tools out there for doing Flex work so maybe I won't have to buy it. :)  Hey Mike Potter, can't you help a developer out and get me a free copy of Flex Builder? :)  Check out <a href="http://flex.org">the Flex web site</a> to see what might be the next wave of internet applications.  Flash is pretty much the only cross-browser technology that always works the same.  Or so I've been led to believe.

<h2>title: Off To php|tek</h2>

<p>I fly out to Chicago tomorrow morning for <a href='http://www.phparch.com/phptek'>php|tek</a> where I'll be giving my talk "What Can PHP Learn From Ruby On Rails" on Thursday.  The talk is significantly different from the one I gave in Vancouver back in February (with colour and graphics even!) as I've cut down the number of slides so I can talk slower and leave room for questions at the end.  If you're going to be in Chicago don't hesitate to come up and talk to me.  I may be grumpy (ask the people on the CakePHP mailing list) but I love to talk about programming and technologies.  Just like last time, I'll be doing a screencast of my talk and posting it up on the site.  It will also be an excuse for me to learn how to properly use Amazon S3 to save on my bandwidth bills. :)
</p>

<p>
On an unrelated note, I'll be able to play with my <a href="http://www.neurosaudio.com/osd/osd.asp">Neuros OSD</a>, an open source media center that runs Linux, when I get back from the conference.  All I need to do is plug in an external drive and I can start recording TV shows and showing movies I already  had before.  Awesome piece of technology and a great price at around US$230 depending on where you buy it from.

<h2>title: Live from php|tek!</h2>

<p>Just finished giving my talk at php|tek 2007, and feedback was good.  Still talked a little too fast, but I think I can conquer that problem.  Anyhow, I totally forgot to record the talk as a screencast (the speaker before me talked all the way through my prep time) so all I can give you is the slides.  If any of the attendees read my blog (c'mon, I know you do!) I'd appreciate some feedback.  I was planning on retiring this talk...but I think it still has some legs for future conferences.</p>
