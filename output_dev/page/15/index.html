<h2>title: Batman Year 100</h2>

<p>Some of you may know that I used to own a comic book store with my <a href="http://www.lisahartjes.com">sister</a> back in the mid-90's.  I haven't bought many comics since the store closed.  Warren Ellis' "Desolation Jones" is just about the only one other than a few graphic novels here and there.</p>

<p>These days I work just around the corner from one of the <a href="http://www.silversnail.com">oldest comic book stores in Toronto</a> so I decided to venture over there and see if I could find a copy of a comic that had generated a lot of buzz by being in an issue of Wired magazine.</p>

<p>Batman 100 is a 4 book series that takes place in some whacked-out, futuristic police-state America in the year 2039.  Bruce Wayne (who should be something like 140 years old at this point) is back as Batman...and the government has no record of who he is or where they can find him.  There's some weirdness going on with the federal gov't, Commissioner Gordon's grandson is Commissioner now, and Batman is now this aggressive, feral creature who doesn't seem to hesitate to try and kill people who get in his way.  Grim and gritty for sure.</p>

<p>They're up to issue 2.  If you're into comics at all I suggest you try and track down some copies.  As is typical of most comics, the first issue is hard to find but issues 2 through 4 should be easy to come by.</p>

<h2>title: Blog Maintenance</h2>

<p>I always like to try new things, so I'm forever destroying my applications trying new things and updating.  Luckily I am smarter with this blog and Serendipity makes it dead simple to upgrade.  Mad props to them.</p>

<p>Over at my &lt;a href="//www.littlehart.net/attheballpark"">other blog</a> I've decided to move it from being served up by the Apache2 + FastCGI combo that is pretty common for <a href="http://www.rubyonrails">Rails</a> applications to being served up by <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net">LightTPD</a>, which is a very lightweight webserver that handles FastCGI much better than Apache2 does.</p>

<p>I mean, Apache2 is great webserver for general purpose stuff, but most of it's features are overkill for my powered-by-Rails blog.  So, I dug around on the Rails wiki and got some great documentation.  Here's what you do:</p>

<p>1) make sure that you install mod_proxy for Apache 2
2) create a rule in your httpd.conf file that tells it to pass all requests for your blog to a webserver running on a different port (in this case it's lighttpd)
3) configure lighttpd to run your Rails blog, with much better control over how many FastCGI processes are running at any one time
4) test the snot out of it
5) cry when things don't work and you don't know why
6) triumph your success on your own blog when you get it to work</p>

<p>The truth is that lighttpd + FastCGI will consume less resources than the Apache2 + FastCGI combination.  The server that hosts both these blogs is getting a good workout these days, so the more memory available for things like JBoss, the better.</p>

<h2>title: When Meme's Attack!</h2>

<p>I've seen a lot of web-based memes floating around.  My <a href="http://www.lisahartjes.com">sister</a> sends a lot of them to me as well.  So, in that spirit, I present to you my Google Image Meme.</p>

<p>For each question, you are supposed to choose one picture from the first page of the search results on Google Image.  So, here we go:</p>

<p>1) The city (and state) of the town you grew up in.</p>

<p>&lt;img src="//www.canadianheritage.org/images/regular/20375.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>

<p>2) The town where you currently reside.</p>

<p>&lt;img src="//www.countryheritagepark.com/map3sm.gif"" alt="""" /></p>

<p>3) Your first and last name</p>

<p>&lt;img src="//www.graafschapfans.nl/database/geenfoto.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>

<p>4) Your grandfather's name</p>

<p>&lt;img src="//www.born-today.com/Today/pix/barth_karl.jpg"" alt="""" />
(not really my grandfather <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" /> )</p>

<p>5) Your favourite food</p>

<p>&lt;img src="//www.pmachinehowto.com/howtogallery/chinese_food_medium.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>

<p>6) Your favourite drink</p>

<p>&lt;img src="//tell.fll.purdue.edu/JapanProj/FLClipart/Nouns/food&amp;drink/beer.gif"" alt="""" /></p>

<p>7) Your favourite smell</p>
