<h2>title: Book Review -- Coders At Work</h2>

<p>I was fortunate enough to get a sneak peek at Peter Seibel's <a href="http://www.codersatwork.com/">Coders At Work</a>, where he interviewed 15 programmers, many of whom are considered legends in programming, to get their thoughts on a wide variety of topics related to programming.  These range from Brad Fitzpatrick (Live Journal and memcached to name some of his well-known projects) to Simon Peyton Jones (one of the creators of Haskell). Although I have not finished the book yet (it's 454 pages and I'm about 200 pages in) it has already left quite an impression on me.</p>

<p>
Mr. Seibel has also previously written an award-winning book about Lisp called "Practical Common Lisp".  With a pedigree like that, how could I ignore a book like this, despite my suspicion that those who understand Lisp are aliens from another planet?
</p>

<p>
While I read a lot of technical books and web sites, I have grown more-and-more to like books that get into the minds of the people behind the technology.  It's not that I'm expecting to find the perfect process for creating awesome projects, because that seems to be the residue of great skill and timing.  I'm interested in reading about the personalities that created these things.  Maybe I'm indulging in a little hero worship, but I can't imagine a better teacher than those who've climbed to the top and also are willing to share their failures along the way.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Peter Seibel seems to have found the right mix of questions and follow-ups to coax information from his interview subjects.  When you read about this larger-than-life people who've built projects that you understand were an huge undertaking have been a success, it's, what word am I looking for, reassuring to find that they are human beings with their own unique personalities, but all driven to succeed.  
</p>

<p>The range of topics covered is just astounding.  I could write a book just summarizing them, another tribute to Mr. Seibel's ability to get his subjects to open up and go into detail.  Not that most techies have a hard time speaking volumes on the topics they are interested in.  I've read thoughts on college CS education, virtual machines, pair programming, learning the value of interfaces to meld wildly different technologies...all things that I am interested in or want to learn more about it.  Perhaps I'm the perfect target audience for a book like this.  Reading these people's thoughts on them makes me realize where I actually have an in-depth understanding and where I have just scratched the surface of the available knowledge.
</p>

<p>
I highly recommend this book if you're interested in finding out what makes some of the people who have helped to build and expand the amazing world-wide computer network we call the Internet tick.  If anything, it will show just how much thought goes into the planning and execution of projects that we sometimes don't give enough credit.

<h2>title: What's In Chris' Brain - September 2009 Edition</h2>

<p>I've been feeling a little blogged-out lately, as work is ramping up on a project with some critical milestones to be met, and the stress of getting my basement lair all renovated for occupation after Labour Day.  But the mind never stops working.  Here's two big things that have been occupying my thoughts:
</p>

<p>
<h3>The arrival of PHP 5.3 and it's impact on frameworks</h3>
</p>

<p>
When I upgraded my MacBook to Snow Leopard I noticed that it comes with PHP 5.3 as part of the standard install.  After I got finished fixing my <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a> install that I somehow butchered while following two different sets of instructions (way to go Chris), I was not at all surprised to find out that the <a href="http://codeigniter.com">framework I shall not say out loud</a> did not like running with PHP 5.3.  Tons of deprecation warnings abounded, and I had lost my enthusiasm for figuring out how to make them go away.  If anyone cares to tell me, feel free to add it to the comments as I would prefer to run 5.3 on my laptop.</p>

<p>
As far as I can tell, <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> is the only framework that is claiming <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/company/news/Press/zend-framework-features-php-readiness-and-new-professional-components">that it will run just fine in PHP 5.3.</a>.  Although I cut my teeth so-to-speak with <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">another framework</a> that has been good to me (hey, <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/book">buy my book to see why</a>, I cannot but remain impressed that a production-ready framework is ready to go with PHP 5.3.
</p>

<h3>Finally figuring out Design Patterns and how they relate to refactoring</h3>

<p>
In <a href="http://www.codersatwork.com">Coders At Work</a> Brandon Eich talks about how Peter Norvig once said (I'm paraphrasing here) "a design pattern shows a flaw in your programming language".  As I'm expanding functionality for <a href="http://www.sportso.com">a project at work</a>, I am starting to wonder if it's maybe time I really looked at them closely.  I see myself doing certain things in my code and wondering if there is an easier way to do them.  You know, the same sort of if-the-else comparisons, having to do the same thing but slightly differently inside a method.  Some of these are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smells</a>, but I am wondering about what's the best way to approach refactoring them.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you always have to consider the environment in which your code lives.  Since I'm using a framework, there are rules I have to follow.  Most of the time, these rules are okay.  Other times I find myself fighting against them a tiny bit, which shows that maybe I need to go and buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1252100204&sr=8-1">seminal classic on refactoring</a> and read it.  Maybe one of my generous readers would send me a copy?

<h2>title: "Lazyweb Help: Busting out of frames"</h2>

<p>Normally I don't ask for time-sensitive help on my blog, but since my readers are such gracious bunch I thought I could count on them to help me out.</p>

<p>
I have a <a href='http://www.agatedepot.com'>site for work</a> that uses frames.  Oh yeah, it's <a href='http://www.cakephp.org'>CakePHP</a> application.  Frames are not my favourite thing in the world, but they are part of this particular site.  Now here is my problem:
<ol>
<li>Users must be authenticated to use the site, and when they log in from the front page a bunch of frames are loaded.  Then they can click around doing stuff.</li>
<li>When their session times out, meaning they need to get logged back in, I need for the frames to disappear and send them back to front page of the site.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
So far, I have not been able to figure out how to do this.  I've been told by reliable sources on Twitter that I probably need some Javascript code that does something like this:

~~~
<script type="text/javascript"> 
if (top !== self) top.location.replace(self.location.href); 
</script>
~~~

but I cannot determine *where* to put that code.  Please help this frames n00b figure it out!
