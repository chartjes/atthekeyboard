<h2>title: "What's In Chris' Brain: January 2008 Edition"</h2>

<p>
Not a lot going on, it's time for a quick round-up post
<ul>
<li>I'm speaking at <a href='http://www.cakefest.org'>CakeFest</a>, so I'm working on my presentation.  Since I'm going to be a combination of slides and actual demonstrations of the Cake console, I'm going to be using <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a> to run the slideshow, then switching to a terminal and my IDE to show people the results</li>
<li>I've run into a weird bug in working with Cake and Postgres, where the code works okay in PHP 5 + Postgres + OS-X, but erroring out in PHP 4 + Postgres + Linux.  If I could figure out a test to recreate the bug, that would be a good step forward.  In a nutshell, for some reason CakePHP is not determining the correct name of the sequence (it's what Postgres uses when determining auto-incremented ID's for a table) in the PHP 4 + Postgres + Linux environment.  It's very weird and I have no idea what might be happening here.  Given that I can't submit a ticket without a test proving the problem, and then figuring out what code to change, this could cause me some headaches.</li>
<li>I suck at writing screen scrapers, which is what I need to make one of my side projects work</li>
<li>Via the ever-increasingly-useful Miro, I have started watching a presentation on <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/">the Lively Kernel</a>.  For some more info about it,  check out this post about how <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/290/JavaScript-is-the-new-Smalltalk">Javascript is the new Smalltalk</a></li>
<li>I've been playing around with different themes for this blog, but nothing seems to work as well as my current setup.  Interesting...</li>
<li>I also experimented with adding some more advertising but that got me nothing in the way of revenue.  Maybe I didn't give it enough time or something. My current set of advertisers (thank you very much, guys and gals) make this blog pay for itself, so I consider that a major accomplishment.
</li>
</ul></p>

title: The Devil's In The Details (or, Handling Sequences in Postgres in CakePHP)
date: 2008-02-02</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>I had been struggling with some weirdness that CakePHP has been displaying while trying to add some new features to the <a href="http://www.ibl.org">baseball league website</a>, where Cake + PHP 4.4 + Postgres were deciding to just be sulky and not work together well.</p>

<p>
So, I was trying to figure out how to make a test for this so I could file a bug (CakePHP not finding the proper name of the Postgres sequence for a table) when I tracked down <a href="http://cake.insertdesignhere.com/">nate</a> on IM to whine to him about this problem, he started bugging me about "not paying attention" when looking around in code to try and track down what I thought was a bug.  If I had looked at the API a little closer I would've been steered towards the solution he gave me.
</p>

<p>
Lucky for me, it turns out that the solution (for now) to the problem was to simply add the name of the sequence for that table as a variable to the model definition.
~~~
<?php
class Vote extends AppModel {

    var $name = 'Vote';
    var $sequence = 'votes_id_seq'; // This is what I added in

    //The Associations below have been created with all possible keys, those that are not needed can be removed
    var $belongsTo = array(
            'BallotItem' => array('className' => 'BallotItem',
                                'foreignKey' => 'ballot_item_id',
                                'conditions' => '',
                                'fields' => '',
                                'order' => ''
            ),
            'Franchise' => array('className' => 'Franchise',
                                'foreignKey' => 'franchise_id',
                                'conditions' => '',
                                'fields' => '',
                                'order' => ''
            )
    );
    var $validate = array('ballot_item_id' => array('rule' => 'numeric',
                                                    'required' => true),
                          'franchise_id' => array('rule' => 'numeric',
                                                  'required' => true),
                          'answer' => array('rule' => 'numeric',
                                            'required' => true,
                                            'message' => 'You must vote on this item')
                         );

}
?>

<p>
This confirmed to me that my new-found respect for trying to come up with the simplest solution to a problem is the correct way to do so.  Since my head is full of all sorts of nonsense (work items, family life, baseball stats, old Dungeons & Dragons adventures from my teenage years) I find that at times I am better served by taking the time to think about the problem rather than start digging around.  Especially when it comes to code that was well-written an has been tested by lots of people, like the overwhelming majority of CakePHP's core code.
</p>

<p>
Thanks again to nate for proving to me that the Devil's in the details.  And continuing to make me feel stupid.

<h2>title: CakeFest, Day 1</h2>

<p>Day 1 of CakeFest is winding down, so I thought I'd talk about today's talks</p>

<p>
First, Garrett "gwoo" Woodworth was they keynote, talking about where CakePHP came from and how he got involved with it both on a coding level and as project manager.  He included a nice little shout-out to my posting about how "the devil's in the details".
</p>

<p>
Next up was Tim Koschuetzki's talk about unit testing in CakePHP.  I'm a lapsed believer in unit tests (as in, I believe in them but still find a way to not do them) and he did a great job of showing how to do them, with some neat points about how he extended some functionality in <a href="http://simpletest.sourceforge.net">SimpleTest</a> to help test web pages.  As an aside, I also met <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org">Felix</a> and while I'm a big guy, Tim and Felix are even bigger than I am.  They grow them big in Deutschland these days.
</p>

<p>
After lunch <a href="http://www.joelmoss.info">Joel Moss</a> gave his talk on implementing database migrations in PHP.  I have experience with migrations from my Rails days, so I might investigate this for use with the IBL web site.
</p>

<p>
Then I gave my talk on using the Cake console.  It was a little shorter than I liked, and I forgot to talk about how the baked views have pagination links in them as well, but it was pretty well received.  All the pictures of my kids (who featured prominently in the slides) generated lots of laughs.
</p>

<p>
After me was a talk by Frederic Bollon about a CakePHP-specific deployment system he called Fredistrano.  Interesting talk, and PhpNut talked about how he thinks it might a viable solution to the problem he faces in updating all the Cake-related sites.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow has two tracks:  API and GUI.  Should be good...
