<h2>title: "I can sleep when I'm dead!"</h2>

<p>That is a phrase I've used more than once with my wife as a way to explain why I'm staying up late screwing around on my computer.  But some side projects have been keeping me up past my normal bed time.</p>

<p>I'm racing to get my Last.fm / Audioscrobbler component for <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> all taken care of.  I've changed it to use <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.http.html#zend.http.client">Zend_Http_Client</a> to talk to the web services, and found a neat trick where I can create a <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.http.client.adapters.html#zend.http.client.adapter.test">test connection</a> for the client.  Why is this needed?  Well, I got told that I needed to create tests that didn't require an internet connection.  Kind of hard for a web service, so luckily Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Test lets me create some tests that don't actually connect to the web service.</p>

<p>
I'm also fortunate enough now to have gained access to <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP's</a> inner circle (i.e. access to the SVN repository) as to make my work on a series of CLI tools (like the interactive console) part of CakePHP itself.  I know it's very nerdy, but I'm excited to contribute to the project.  Having an interactive console for a framework is a huge advantage for quickly testing something.  There are lots of examples for the Ruby on Rails crowd for how to use the console for tryign things out.  Thanks to Nate and Larry for letting me join the club.
</p>

<p>
I'm a little behind on development work because I'm still waiting to get my new laptop from my new job, but once I get that I anticipate churning out a beta of the interactive console in short order.

<h2>title: Riding Off Into The Sunset</h2>

<p>Today was my last day at <a href="http://www.verticalscope.com">Verticalscope</a>.  While I will miss the guys I work with (I'm looking at you, Rick) I sure won't miss the commute.  Also, I won't miss that nagging feeling in the back of my mind that kept telling me it was time to move on.  "Know when to go" is something I've talked about before on this blog, and it was very appropriate this time.</p>

<p>If you're expecting me to dish dirt on why exactly I left (those who know me obviously know the whole story) you won't find it here.  My now-former co-workers have a very tough road ahead of them:  rolling out a new network and trying to see if one site can make enough to support 40 other ones.  I don't envy them their task, but I won't be worrying about it as I sit in my dining room in the comfort of my own home coding away.  I know my former boss reads this blog (hi Jonathan) so I want to say this:  I enjoyed my time there, but I'm disappointed things didn't work out the way I had hoped.</p>

<p>So, now it's time to turn my attention to helping <a href="http://www.syneron.com">Syneron</a> and getting my practically-brand-new 17" MacBook Pro configured as my development environment.  Where did I put that PHP 5.2.1 install package...</p>

title: How Easy Are Web Services in CakePHP 1.2?  Really Easy!
date: 2007-03-13</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2006/11/29/using-cakephps-native-web-service-support/">previous post</a> I talked about how to use the built-in web services in <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> 1.1.x.x.  A very popular piece too according to my site statistics too.  Well, I've discovered that it's even easier in Cake 1.2.x.x.  I bugged Nate via IM for some tips on how to put it together, and it's really very simple.
</p>

<p>
The biggest change is that the old way of doing custom routing in web services is gone in favour of handling them via extensions.  In the past, you would go into app/config/core.php and enable the special web services routing.  I was trying to do a web service with the URL http://localhost/cake_dev/foo and have it spit out an XML response.  According to what I was told "...going forward the routes part / extensions on the end of the URL is the recommended way of doing it".  So, if I was doing this the standard way I would be calling http://localhost/cake_dev/foo/index.xml.  I just like the cleaner URL.  Now, if I was to do it the proper way, I would add in the following to my app/config/routes.php file:
~~~
/**
 * Add in support for web services by enabling generating output based on extension
 */
Router::parseExtensions();
~~~
</p>

<p>Now, go and create your controller that will handle spitting out some XML:
~~~
/**
 * Test controller for built-in web services in Cake 1.2.x.x
 *
 * @author Chris Hartjes
 *
 */

class FooController extends AppController
{
    var $components = array('RequestHandler');
    var $uses = '';
    var $helpers = array('Text', 'Xml');
    
    function index()
    {
        $message = 'Testing';
        $this->set('message', $message);
        $this->RequestHandler->respondAs('xml');
        $this->viewPath .= '/xml';
        $this->layoutPath = 'xml';
    }
}
~~~
So what am I doing here?  I make sure to use the RequestHandler component so it understands that I want to spit out some XML, and I made sure to include the Xml helper.  Next, I tell the request handler that I want the output to be XML instead of HTML by using respondAs('xml').  Finally, I do some more controller voodoo (Nate contributed this part) by setting $this->viewPath and $this->layoutPath so that I don't have to specify index.xml to get it to spit out results.  A call to http://localhost/cake_dev/foo will spit out an XML result based on my template, which I put into app/views/foo/xml/index.ctp:
~~~
<foo>
    <bar>< ?php print $message; ?></bar>
</foo>
~~~
That spits out the following XML document:
~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<foo>
    <bar>Testing</bar>
</foo>
~~~
</p>

<p>I'm hoping to use this setup for some web services I have to write for work but my boss likes <a href="http://framework.zend.com">some other framework</a>, which isn't surprising since he used to work for them.  I will continue to fight for my right to eat Cake.  Besides, it's all part of my evil plan to get paid to contribute code to the CakePHP project.  I mean, if I need to create an interactive console to do testing then I can build it with Cake and give it back to the community while getting paid at the same time.  What could be better?
