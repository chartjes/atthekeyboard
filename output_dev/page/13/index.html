title: Poka-Yoke!
date: 2006-03-01</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>I sent in my article to <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a> on Monday.  I'm feeling a little anxious about what they may (or may not) ask me to do to the article to get it ready for publication.  Hopefully nothing major (although I can say without hesitation that my diagram drawing skills suck).</p>

<p>The February issue of the magazine came out yesterday.  I find that in every issue there is always one article that I read that makes me go "woah!  Now <strong>that</strong> is a cool idea."  This month <a href="http://blogs.phparch.com/mt/">Marco Tabini</a>, the publisher of php|architect, has a very cool article on using PHP 5's Standard PHP Library to create what is called a poka-yoke, a Japanese term that means "fail-safe mechanism".</p>

<p>It shows how to create a input-filtering object that prevents a developer from mishandling the data that is in the superglobals most commonly used for user input ($_GET, $_POST and $_REQUEST).  You can also do it with any of the other superglobals.  Personally, I can see using it for $_SESSION right away.</p>

<p>Anyhow, great article Marco!  And I hope he likes my article on "Scaling PHP Applications".</p>

title: Zend Framework Preview
date: 2006-03-06</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>Well...the folks over at Zend have released an incredibly alpha version of their <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> for the overanxious developer (such as myself) to check out and see if they can get it working.</p>

<p>Well, I grabbed it...and started working on it with my laptop...and I'm disappointed.  Why?  It's not even close to being usable for what most people will use it for, which is database-driven web sites.  Yeah, it's got some really cool web services components that do work, but I want to use it to build the new IBL web site.  The provided documentation is actually incorrect in how you create an instance of any of the database objects, which is disappointing as well.</p>

<p>I'm happy it's out, for sure.  And I await the next version.  Hopefully with working database components.</p>

title: The Grim Meathook Future
date: 2006-03-09</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>I very rarely stray into the world of politics on my blog...but this is too good to pass up.  Please read this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/">The Grim Meathook Future</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com">Warren Ellis</a> (not like he's a close personal friend or anything) for bringing it to my attention via his latest <a href="http://www.comicon.com/pulse/">THE MINISTRY</a> column:</p>

<blockquote>
Oh ... Spime Future? No, I'm not totally convinced of the Spime Future, or, as it is also sometimes known, The Internet Of Things. The idea is close to that of the noosphere, an invisible world of information flows. A Spime is an object (or blobject, or blogject) that exists as, around and within a constantly-updated, totally-recorded flow of information. In Sterling's words, "A Spime is an object that ate and internalized the previous industrial order."

In practise, it's probably going to turn into that dumb idea of internet fridges that email shopping lists to the supermarket. If it's anything like my local Tesco online delivery service, the groceries won't turn up for four days and will be missing half the stuff you ordered anyway. Bruce Sterling wrote an excellent book on spimes called SHAPING THINGS, published by MIT Media Lab, which I recommend to you. A lot of people are thinking about this right now, and the conversation will soon start leaking into the wider world. There's also a fair chance that more and more people will be implanting hacked Radio Frequency ID tags and the like into themselves over the next few years. Which leads me to:

There's a middle distance between the complete collapse of infrastructure and some weird geek dream of electronically knowing where all your stuff is. (I'm cheating: the end result of pure spime theory is electronic omniscience, which is not a useless concept.) Between apocalyptic politics and nerdvana is the human dimension; how this stuff is taken onboard by smart people at street level. You all know Bill Gibson's saw from his cyberpunk novels, that the street finds its own use for things. It still holds. But, right now, I think there's an urgency and a sense of envelope-pushing in exactly what uses are found for these things.
