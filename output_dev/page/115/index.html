<h2>title: "Building Rallyhat: Out of the cloud and onto a slice"</h2>

<p>The fall and winter are really the time of year when I can sink my virtual teeth into side projects.  During the summer I'm too busy playing softball or games in my <a href="http://www.ibl.org">simulation baseball league</a>, so now that both seasons are done or winding down I can take a look at a side project that's been percolating in my brain for several years.  Late last night I pushed an extremely rough and not-completely-finished version of my application, which I call <a href="http://www.rallyhat.com">Rallyhat</a>.</p>

<p>
It's build using the latest official version of <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> (which is 1.1.1 as of this writing) and originally I thought of putting up on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> long-term.  I did, and it was a hacked-up version of the app without the proper registration links working.  When you add in that I was using a patched version of Django in order to just run on there, I decided it would be smarter if I used regular Django.  You know, learn how the damn thing actually works.  And run it on an environment close to what I would expect, which is Apache using mod_python.  I will probably tinker with it to get to work with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">mod_wsgi</a> as a next step.
</p>

<p>
So, in order to stop procrastinating I decided to put what I actually had working up onto the web for people to see.  Warts and all.
</p>

<p>
The idea for the site is allow people to plan activities that involve them going from one place to another.  Think baseball road trip.  Think pub crawl.  Think anything where you need to go to a bunch of places in sequential order.  Your membership in the site will allow you to save those searches to review later.  I've been toying with allowing members to look at ALL searches made by people, but there might be some privacy issues related to doing that.  You might not want people to know what you're planning. ;)
</p>

<p>
The resulting interface will be slicker, better annotation on the points you've selected, etc.  It's really rough right now so don't think this is the final version or anything. ;)
</p>

<p>
So check it out and play with it.  Don't worry if you break something, hopefully I can learn enough to fix it. ;)
</p>

<p>
In my next post I will share some of the code I was using, sort of mini code-review if you will to make sure I am on the way to writing idiomatic Python (or Javascript in some cases).

<h2>title: New Site for "Refactoring Legacy Applications using CakePHP"</h2>

<p>
While looking around for conferences to speak at that were within a decent drive of my home, I managed to come into contact with <a href="http://twitter.com/wjgilmore">Jason Gilmore</a>, who also sells PHP books via <a href="http://www.easyphpwebsites.com/">EasyPHPWebsites</a>.  He saw that I had written this book and offered to put it up for sale via his site.  As a result, the price of the book has gone up by $3 to handle some of the new costs, but I'm much happier with the marketing effort that will be accompanying the book.   Jason makes his living doing this sort of thing, so I'm happy to have a mentor for this process.  I have plans for future books, some of them not even in PHP. ;)
</p>

<p>
Bundled with the PDF will be access to some PHP-related screencasts.  Unfortunately I will not be able to offer videos to existing customers, only for new purchasers of the book.
</p>

<p>
The cost of the print-on-demand copy hasn't changed, and sometime later today I will be uploading a version of the book with the hot new cover.  I don't think the price will be changing at all.

<h2>title: RIP - Quenton 08/21/98 to 10/28/09</h2>

<p><img src='http://www.littlehart.net/quenton-rip.jpg'/></p>

<p>I had to say goodbye today to an old and dear friend.</p>

<p>
This morning at 6:45AM my wife went downstairs to give our two cats their morning treats.  We could not find our oldest cat Quenton.  My wife went into the basement to see if he was down there and found him laying in the litter box, unable to get up and walk.  We had no idea what was wrong, but I got dressed as quick as I could, called the 24 hour animal hospital to get directions and took him there.
</p>

<p>
A blood clot had led to Quenton having a stroke.  He had likely been in pain for several hours before we discovered him.  He did not complain at all until my wife had found him, and then it was obvious he was in pain.  His chances for recovery where nil, so we had him put to sleep.  I was there at the end with him, telling him he was such a wonderful pet and I would miss him dearly.
</p>

<p>
We got Quenton 6 days after we got married.  The first date above is when we adopted him.  We have no idea how old he really was, probably 13 or 14.  It was my first cat (I had dogs when I was younger) and we adopted him from a cat rescue program in Toronto.  He had bounced around to 7 different shelters before we adopted him and saved him.  He was a beautiful black and white cat, very large but lean and super friendly towards people.  He would act like a bully at times towards our younger cat we got afterwards, but that's the dominance game for you.
</p>

<p>
I know people might think I'm a bit of dick the way I talk to people at times.  But I loved this damn cat.  He was my companion during the times when I was out of work and looking after my oldest daughter when she was a baby.  He would jump up into my lap and sit with me when I was working on the computer, but stopped doing it when I started working in the basement 4 years ago.
</p>

<p>
He was my wife's constant companion after dinner, climbing up into her lap while she was watching TV.  He'd stand next to me at the dinner table, not begging for scraps (because he knew I wouldn't give him any) but just because he wanted me to pet him.
</p>

<p>
I can't believe he's gone.  I can't believe he had to suffer in such a horrible way.  I will never forget you Quenton.  You can call me a softie for caring so much about a pet, but I don't care.   I can always get another pet, but I will never be able to replace you.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to miss your deep rumbling purr any time one of us got near you.  I'm going to miss how you would always be so excited that I picked you up for a cuddle that you would drool on me and only me.  I'm going to miss so many things about you that I simply cannot put into words.
</p>

<p>
I know you're in a better place now Quenton.  Thanks for 11 years of wonderful memories.  I'm so sorry I had to put you to sleep.  I don't know if I can ever get over it.
</p>
