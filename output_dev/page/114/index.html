<h2>title: Open Source Is Really About Documentation - Twisted vs. Tornado</h2>

<p>I think I can give you an executive summary of this blog post:  if the documentation for an open source project sucks, nobody but the most hardcore developers will use it.</p>

<p>
What has prompted this incredibly brilliant stating-of-the-obvious?  The reaction by those in the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a> community over Facebook's pre-emptive strike in the non-blocking Python-based web server space by open sourcing a framework they are using internally called <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a>.  Why are the Twisted folks getting all twisted (look how funny I am!) up about this?  Like any good Open Source project for people who are interested in Getting Things Done, Tornado is dissing Twisted by basically saying "yeah, we thought about using Twisted but it wasn't easy enough for us to use and we think it sucks".  I'm pretty sure I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.
</p>

<p>
Now, I have looked at Twisted and have come to the following conclusions:
<ul>
<li>It looks awesome</li>
<li>It is built for people who are supposed to understand what they are doing</li>
<li>The documentation sucks</li>
<li>The examples on how to build anything of any significance are, to this developer, non-existant and/or difficult to find without shelling out for a possibly very-outdated book</li>
</ul>
Contrast this with Tornado.  I've looked at Tornado and have come to the following conclusions:
<ul>
<li>It looks awesome</li>
<li>It is built for people who are supposed to understand what they are doing</li>
<li>The documentation is inside the comments on the code which sucks only if you're not into reading the code</li>
<li>It includes a sample application so you can see something other than Hello World</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Am I biased towards Tornado?  You bet.  Why?  Because as hard as I tried, I could not find USEFUL documentation on how to build things using Twisted.  Maybe I didn't use the right search terms.  Maybe I didn't dig down enough links deep on the Twisted site.  Maybe I didn't fully understand the terminology or architecture of Twisted and how they different components speak to each other.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you this though:  I am not having any such problems with Tornado.  This is coming across as a criticism aimed towards Twisted, and I suppose that's fair.  I've noticed complaints from the Twisted community which really amount to whining.  I understand that attitude totally.  I've been there, when faced with competition that just might be doing a better job then I am doing.  But complaining that Facebook should've simply fixed up Twisted instead of writing their own is not productive.  Productive is understanding that Facebook looking at Twisted and said "this is not for us because *we* don't find it easy enough to use" is a sign that something serious is wrong with Twisted's documentation.   You could have the most awesome non-blocking web server available, but if people with who WANT to use it can't figure out HOW to use it, well, what can you say to that?  Only the most dedicated open source contributors would've done that.  Most will say "meh, I want to do this myself so I understand it" and then Twisted will die an obscure death while Tornado plunges forward gaining mindshare amongst people interested in the type of applications you can build with this technology.  In my opinion, it's all because of the lack of clear, freely available documentation for Twisted.
</p>

<p>
If there is an online source BETTER than the Twisted site, please share the link love in the comments so I can try and do a better comparison of the two at a documentation level.  For someone like me, who is new to Python but old to the idea of web frameworks, I think that would be the fairest comparison.

<h2>title: Chris' Brain - Almost October 2009 Edition</h2>

<p>Can you tell I have nothing earth-shattering to talk about?  Here are the two things taken up processing space in my brain</p>

<h3>I won't use frameworks without built-in testing support any more</h3>

<p>
I'm doing some very hairy refactoring of code at work to support a new concept of ownership of content generated by the application.  If I had been honest with myself and started the project with TDD practices, I'd be in much better shape.  While <a href="http://codeigniter.com">the framework that it was built with</a> is all the things it talks about, it is a non-trivial task to add a testing harness to it.  I'm trying to setup <a href="http://jamierumbelow.net/2009/08/11/setting-up-the-perfect-codeigniter-tdd-environment/">this environment</a> but I've run into a problem with being too stupid to figure out the changes to my Apache .htaccess file to make it work (UPDATE:  Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/spooons">@spooons</a> for helping me out to get it working).</p>

<p>
So you can take your lightweight frameworks and chuck them out the window if I have to waste more than 15 minutes of my time figuring out how to write tests for it.  TDD is an essential tool when you get to the maintenance phase of a project. 
</p>

<h3>Django Applications are doing things right</h3>

<p>
If you use Django, you can find lots of third-party applications that you can literally drop into place into your existing one and start using it.  Can you imagine doing this with your favourite PHP framework?  Being ignorant, I have no idea how easy it would be to create something like <a href="http://uswaretech.com/blog/2009/08/django-socialauth-login-via-twitter-facebook-openid-yahoo-google/">Django-Socialauth</a> for Zend Framework, where you can drop it into your application and it comes with templates and models and controllers for handling all these things.   I was astounded by both the foresight that went into Django that allows people, as long as they follow specific conventions, to create standalone applications that you can use in pretty much any Django application.  As long as you haven't hacked Django itself too much.

<h2>title: Solutions Looking For A Problem</h2>

<p>(Personal note: wow, 2 weeks since I blogged something.  Can you tell I've been in refactoring mode, not writing new code for work projects and finishing off my <a href="http://www.ibl.org">simball league season</a>. (Go MAD!))</p>

<p>
The intertubes have been all clogged-up with news about Google opening up limited access to <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a>, and I am not too proud to admit that I attempted to get an invite by following certain people on Twitter.  They never came through with that invite though.  Oh well.
</p>

<p>
As cool as Google Wave appears to be, at it's very core I believe that it is a solution look for a problem.  The solution as far as I can tell is a real-time mailing list where you can imbed all sorts of things into it.   I imagine the technology behind it is very impressive (even noticed my friend <a href="http://marcgrabanski.com/">Marc Grabanski</a> commenting on Twitter that it appears to be using some of his open-sourced jQuery code) but I can't help but wonder what problem is this solving?
</p>

<p>
Is it a competitor for things like IRC or <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a>.  I look at Google Wave and think to myself "wait until the spammers figure out how to exploit this".  Perhaps a very cynical view, but I think it's a realistic one.  But most of all, what problem is this solving that already exists?
</p>

<p>
As software developers, we all have lots of ego.  It's what allows us to ignore mountains of code that provides solutions to the problems we face and instead plow ahead recreating those solutions because we are convinced that our problem is unique and existing solutions are unsuited for the task.  Sometimes this is even true, and I tip my hat to those developers who create these kind of solutions.  What category Wave belongs in depends on factors that are totally out of Google's control.
</p>

<p>
Before you get all "you are nothing but a hater, you old curmudgeon" I understand that technologies spring forth that end up being revolutionary.  They often solve existing problems in very subtle ways and then some sort of tipping-point-event happens that shows how useful it is.  Twitter is like that, having become a microblogging service that many people have figured out how to take advantage off (including myself).  Until I can figure out the tipping-point-event for Wave, I remain convinced that it is a solution looking for a problem to solve.   With any broadcast method on the net, the spammers WILL figure out a way to exploit it unless you can prevent people from having to hear their messages.  Twitter is great for that because you can just ignore the spammers (which a lot of them don't seem to understand or even care about).
</p>

<p>
Google Wave reminds me of IRC with a prettier wrapper around it via a web-based interface.  Is that really that earth-shattering?  Not to me it isn't, but I am thinking that I am not the person that Google Wave is being aimed at.
</p>

<p>
If you care to, let me know in the comments why I should take a second look at Google Wave.
