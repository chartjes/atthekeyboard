<h2>title: Bug Hunting Should Be Taught To Beginners</h2>

<p>
It's really a shame that most advanced bug-hunting techniques aren't learned until you've actually had to go through them.  I wish that I had seen <a href="http://adc.jgwong.org/index.php/2006/11/23/effective-bugfixing-techniques-for-php/">this post on effective bugfixing techniques</a> when I first was learning PHP.  I'd say my bug-fixing skills are about 10 times better than what they were 4 years ago.  Working on a complicated site will do that to you.
</p>

<p>
I think the biggest lesson you can take away from that article is to NEVER assume anything about the way your code works.  The weirdest bugs are the ones that result from assumptions on how things work.  This is why unit testing can be a big help, as it can let other people verify that your code is behaving the way you assume it is.

<h2>title: "Speaking at php|tek "</h2>

<p>I got an email this morning from <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a> telling me that my proposal to give my "What PHP Can Learn From Ruby On Rails" has been expected.  My talk is tentatively scheduled for May 17th at 4:00PM.</p>

<p>
For more info check out the <a href="http://hades.phparch.com/ceres/public/tek/page/index.php/schedule">conference schedule</a> to see what else is being offered.  Hope to see you there!

<h2>title: Sometimes The Weirdest Problems Have The Simplest Solutions</h2>

<p>
A bug had been driving me CRAZY at work for a long time.  No matter what I changed in the code, the bug would still rear it's ugly head.  It would work PERFECTLY in development, but when you push the code to production it would generate the same bug.  I spent tons of time trying to figure out the difference between the data that the code would see in production (XML stream) and the data samples I had gotten from our partner for that piece of code.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I decided maybe it was time to take a different approach.  I put in some code that would notify me if an XML document that I had generated couldn't be read in by a simplexml_load_file statement.  Sure enough, that was the problem.  Permissions issues.
</p>

<p>
Ugh.  Don't I feel like a total moron.  Later tonight when the next set of results makes their way down the XML stream I will see if my latest discovery is actually the proper fix.
