<h2>title: Carpenter or Sculptor?</h2>

<p>Now, this might sound like a weird thing to say, but as a programmer I think you fall in one of two categories:  you're a carpenter or you're a sculptor.  This relates to how you build your applications from scratch, and it says a lot about your programming style.</p>

<p>A carpenter starts with a few pieces of wood and then starts cutting them, shaping them and building something.  Carpenter developers are the ones most likely to keep their code small and elegant, like they are a craftsman building a nice piece of furniture.  They will measure and cut and shape smaller pieces to make something bigger.  They start of small, and seem to know exactly how to fit the pieces together, often creating code that is easy to extend.  Sometimes there are few unnecessary pieces (think of it as intricated carvings) but, damnit, their code always looks good.  Sadly, this is not me.</p>

<p>Sculptor developers, on the other hand, start off with a large block of raw code.  Then they start to see the application and start to chip away at, smoothing things, carving what you see inside it. You find flaws that are hard to overcome, but you do your best to work around them.  In the end, you keep going until you see the vision you had at the beginning, and you've removed everything that isn't needed to make the vision happen.  This is how I tend to do things.</p>

<p>
Which method is better?  I'm not really sure.  I think the carpenter will get stuff done faster because they start with less, slowly adding onto it by concentrating on making sure everything fits together nicely.  The sculptor takes longer because they create a huge base of code and that start removing things, or reshaping the application as they go along.  In the end, you get to the same point, a working application, but was it worth all the effort?
</p>

<p>I started thinking about this today because I'm building an Ajax-powered playlist editor for my IPTV project at work.  I banged out a ton of code for the editor and, frankly, I'm not happy with it all.  I feel like I've done this the brute-force way and that I will be doing some heavy refactoring to get to that elegant, "metrosexual" code that my boss seems to effortlessly create.  He's a carpenter in the way he builds his code, and I'm striving to learn all I can.  His refactoring skills are great, which is good for a sculptor like me.  Could I ever be a carpenter?  I find it unlikely, but I can learn to apply a precision chainsaw to my big block of raw code to get to the finished product faster.  Let me know in the comments what category you feel you are under.

title: Form Validation with jQuery
date: 2007-05-04</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>Now that I have to actually design interfaces for other people, I am learning the finer details of Javascript.  Specifically, I'm using <a href="http://jquery.org">JQuery</a> as my library of choice.  I won't go into why I'm using, just go to the site and see it for yourself.  One of the things I've had to build recently is a playlist editor for the IPTV project.  I decided to be user-friendly for once, and make it Ajax-powered.  So this meant a lot of work creating small little actions in my Zend Framework code to accept form posts, etc.  Still cleaning things up, but I wanted to share some of the coolness from using a <a href="http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/">jQuery form plugin </a>.</p>

<p>
So, never having really done any Javascript form validation (I know you're shocked) I unleashed my inner "programmer" to go and hack away at it so I can figure it out, then call back my inner "developer" to make the code elegant and compact.  It took me all morning but I figured it out thanks to Google and just hacking away at it.  One of the neat things about Javascript is that it supports the ability to dynamically define functions in your code.  With it's extensive use of callbacks, jQuery leverages this to the hilt. I believe this is what the Ruby crowd refers to as "blocks and closures".  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  Okay, so here's some code that illustrates how I was doing validation of the form:
<br />
~~~
function saveBinary(playlist) {
    var options = {
        beforeSubmit: validateBinary,
        success: function() {
            $("div#media").load("/elostv/getBinaries/playlist/" + playlist);
            $("div#editMedia").html('<div align = "center"><br />Added media </div>'
                + '<a onclick="addBinaries(\'' + playlist + '\')">Add media</a>');
        }
    }

    $("#addMedia").ajaxSubmit(options);
}
~~~
</p>

<p>
Isn't that nice?  Compact, simple, readable.  All the things a developer strives for.  In summary, the .ajaxSubmit() method lets you define a bunch of callback functions as part of the submission process.  The 'beforeSubmit' is used to handle validation, while the 'success' is stuff that gets triggered if the form submission comes back ok.  Here's the validation code (again, very simple and I'll save the advanced regex matching for the beta).  Here's the validation callback:
<br />
~~~
function validateBinary(formData, jqForm, options) {
    var allFields = true;

    for (var i=0; i < formData.length; i++) {
        if (!formData[i].value) {
            allFields = false;
        }
    }

    if (!allFields) {
        alert('Please fill out every field in the form!');
        return false;
    }
}
~~~
</p>

<p>
Now that I've done this once, I imagine the second time around will be much easier.  Trying to keep things simple when you're on a very tight schedule can be difficult, and I think I've done that despite a few missteps while trying to figure out what jQuery plugin to use to handle my form stuff.</p>

<h2>title: Where Are The Good Development Tools For PHP?</h2>

<p>"After PHP 6, I think that's it for PHP."  Those words were spoken to me by my boss while we were having lunch at the crazy-busy sushi buffet restaurant near the office.  I choked a bit on my food.  After all, my boss is a former Zend employee and utterly competent PHP programmer.  "There's no innovation going on in the language."</p>

<p>"Well, what sort of innovation do you think Rasmus and the boys should be doing?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"It's not about the language, because there is lots to like.  It's the tools.  Ever watch a .Net programmer build something?  Visual Studio is the best tool around for building applications.  Things like Zend Studio and Komodo are 10 years behind.  You're struggling with the interface for that playlist editor, right?  There should be drag-and-drop interface tools that integrate with your PHP code.  Your friends from ActiveState should be trying to one-up Visual Studio, not building tools for script kiddies."</p>

<p>Having never seen a .Net programmer at work, I'll have to take Daniel's word for it.  But he does have a point.  It's clear to me that Adobe and Microsoft have decided the best way to dominate the internet is to ignore those pesky developers and instead try to turn designers, who know how to build decent interfaces, into developers as well.  Adobe Flex and the new Microsoft Silverlight are perfect examples of this, and are even stealing ideas from the while Getting Real crowd:  build the interface first, then plug in the code behind it.</p>

<p>So I ask you, where are the tools to turn guys like me into passable interface designers?  Why do I have to code Ajax interfaces in PHP by hand?  How much time am I going to have to waste trying to code Javascript and integrate things like TinyMCE into my applications.  Where is Visual Studio for PHP?  Or, more importantly, does Visual Studio let you do drag-and-drop interface design with PHP?</p>

<p>Of course, now I wonder if Daniel is right.  Should I be learning other tools?  The answer is, of course, yes.  I'm already doing that by my commitment to learning Javascript to make all this Ajax stuff work properly.  But what about PHP?  Did PHP make a mistake by making such a bold leap from PHP 4 to PHP 5?  Possibly.  Converting an app from PHP 4 to PHP 5 is usually simply not doable, because if you are really going to take advantage of the new features of PHP you have rewrite your app.  Having worked with PHP 5 for a while now, I have to agree.  Yes, your PHP 4 app can run on PHP 5 but what do you gain?  Not much.</p>

<p>So what should I do know.  Ruby on Rails?  For all the neat stuff going on, it's still such a very small part of the web development world, and I still have my doubts about how you scale out a Ruby on Rails app.  Yes, I know, build it first and worry about it later, but I think it's still a valid question.  Is it time to learn how to use Flex?  Is it time to leave the cozy confines of OS-X and go over to the Microsoft world? What is out there?  When I'm at php|tek next week I'll start asking some questions of developers there to see what they think.</p>
