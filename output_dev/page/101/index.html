title: My Sevent Things
author: Chris Hartjes</p>

<h2>date: 2009-01-03</h2>

<p>Interesting meme running round on the net, mostly via Twitter, where you tag seven people, and those who get tagged are supposed to share seven things about themselves.  In turn, those seven people should tag seven other people, and so on, and so forth.  I was tagged by <a href="http://blog.phpdeveloper.org/?p=113">Chris Cornutt aka enygma</a>, the unstoppable force behind PHPDeveloper.org and <a href="http://joind.in">Joind.in</a>.  Just to slightly correct him, I didn't actually create the image on the <a href="http://www.printfection.com/atthekeyboard">Framework Apocalypse t-shirt</a>, I was smart enough to get someone to draw it for me.  Prepare yourself for seven things you might not know about me:
</p>

<ol>
<li><i>I got paid to write my first computer program when I was 12 or 13</i>.  My first computer was a Commodore VIC-20, which I got when I was 10 or 11.  My mother was teaching computers and math at a private school in Toronto, and they needed someone to do up a salary grid for the teachers' pay.  Written in Apple BASIC on an Apple IIGS, complete with user input AND verification of the data they entered.</li>
<li><i>Although I have a diploma in computer science from community college, I also have a diploma in civil engineering</i></li>.  When it was time to go to college, I listened to my father who told me there would always be work in construction.  When I graduated, the construction industry in the Toronto area went into it's worst slump in a long time.  I remember sending out almost 100 resumes (this is pre-internet days, so all by mail or fax), hearing back from 3 places and getting hired by 1.  After a summer of working for minimum wage and 60 hours a week, I decided to go back to school and study what I really enjoyed, which was computer programming.
<li><i>My wife and I met at work</i>.  We were both working at a small ISP, she in sales and me doing phone support.  I was totally oblivious that she was interested in me and until one of her co-workers pushed her into asking me out for dinner after work one day.  10+ years of marriage later, we have two little girls and enjoying watching them grow up.</li>
<li><i>My mom and sister blog</i>, making us a truly wired family.  My mother talks about all her experiences at her blog <a href="http://www.teachersatrisk.com">Teachers At Risk</a>.  My sister, a stay-at-home mom and frustrated writer, shares her progress on her novel over at <a href="http://www.lisahartjes.com">her blog</a>.</li>
<li><i>I used to own a comic book store</i>.  Back in the mid '90s, my sister and I started up a comic store at a strip mall around the corner from where we lived.  It lasted one year and we burned through all the money our father had given to us.  In the end, it was a totally bad location despite what we thought.  I worked Saturdays and Sundays in the store and there were days when nobody came in at all.</li>
<li><i>I learned German on Saturday mornings for seven years as a kid</i>.  My parents are both of German descent, and they sent my sister and I to German heritage school for many years.  My oldest daughter goes to the same school now, 20+ years later, at *her* insistence.  I understand German better than I speak it, and often just use it to yell at my cats.  But it's starting to come back despite all my best efforts to bury the trauma of never being able to watch Saturday morning cartoons.</li>
<li><i>I'm writing a book</i>.  Inspired by P?draic Brady's self-published book about <a href="http://http://www.survivethedeepend.com/">Zend Framework</a>, I've started working on what I believe is a much-needed subject:  a guide to converting legacy applications over to using the <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> framework.  I've already got the outline for the book done, the introduction is written and the first two chapters half-written as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>
So, who shall be my next victims?  I've tried to think of people whom others haven't talked about yet at all, and the list is pretty small. Although some of these people aren't really close friends, I think they are all the type of people you should all get to know better.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://debuggable.com">Felix Geisend?rfer</a>, CakePHP guru and co-owner of an awesome consultancy based out of Deutschland.</li>
<li><a href="http://jan.prima.de/">Jan Lehnard</a>, CouchDB evangelist and reluctant PHP coder (as far as I can tell).  Always super helpful when asked for help, and the master of the human helicopter presentation technique</li>
<li><a href="http://www.openkomodo.com/blogs/jeffg">Jeff Graham</a>, who works at Activestate and promotes Komodo, OpenKomodo and PHP as well.  I've met him at a few conferences, genuinely nice guy and he's Canadian on top of it.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.derekmartin.ca">Derek Martin</a>, former co-worker at an adult dating web site and co-contributor of our Zend_Service_Audioscrobbler component for Zend Framework.</li>
<li><a href="http://funkatron.com">Ed Finkler</a>, the awesomely talented developer behind <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a>, a Twitter client written in Adobe Air.  I'll forgive him for using Code Igniter</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Looks like mostly everyone else has already been tagged.  So spread the meme and the world know a little bit more about yourself.

<h2>title: CakePHP Mythbusters!</h2>

<p>I ran across an article <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/web/PhpFrameworksComparingCakePhpAndSymfony">comparing CakePHP and Symfony</a> and found that the writer had a number of preconceived ideas about CakePHP.  These same ideas keep popping up everywhere, used by people looking to get their hate on about CakePHP.  I sent a very well-reasoned email to the writer clearing up some of those misconceptions, and (to his credit) he replied to me saying:

<blockquote>"Thanks for a brilliant email reply to my blog post about CakePHP and
symfony - and taking the time out to send it. Thanks so much for the
pointers and corrections."</blockquote>
So, in the interest of clarifying things about CakePHP I thought I would share that email, slightly rewritten for this blog posting, but the content is roughly the same.
</p>

<h3>Lack of Documentation</h3>

<p>
Man, this one will just not die.  One complaint seems to be the lack of documentation similar to what Symfony has.  I think that's totally fair in that there are very few *detailed* books out there explaining how to use Cake.  However, I feel that there is more than enough information on people's blogs on how to build things using CakePHP.  So, perhaps it requires time to search around via Google or your other favourite search engine, so I can understand how people are unable to find one unified source for this info.  I don't think you could ever have one definitive source for info about Cake, and the majority of contributors to Cake blog about it.  If I had to pick what I would call the definitive source out of the crowd, it would be <a href="http://book.cakephp.org">the CakePHP Cookbook</a>.
</p>

<h3>Scaffolding</h3>

<p>While I think scaffolding is a great idea to show off the strength of CakePHP, it is a toy and I have never used the scaffolding to build anything other than a throw-away prototype.  I use 'cake bake' to generate the "scaffolding"  for my application and then edit those files.  In fact, I'd say that 'cake bake' is the essential tool that anyone who uses CakePHP needs to start using RIGHT NOW if they are not already.
</p>

<p>It is my personal opinion that showing people the scaffolding stuff that Cake uses by default is counter-productive and a waste of time.  It just confuses them and leads to frustration, which is clearly what has happened to you here.  So if you want to use CakePHP, just don't use the scaffolding at all.</p>

<h3>Models are tied to controllers in a 1:1 relationship</h3>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.  Here's a sample of some code from a project I was working on that shows this</p>

<pre><code>class CalendarController extends AppController {
    var $name = 'Calendar';
    var $uses = array('UserClient', 'CalendarPending', 'LegalCase');

    function admin_index() {
        $results = $this-&gt;UserClient-&gt;Location-&gt;findByLocationId($this-&gt;Auth-&gt;user('location_id'));
        $pending_depositions = $this-&gt;CalendarPending-&gt;find('all', array('conditions' =&gt; array('location' =&gt; $results['Location']['name'])));
        $cases = $this-&gt;LegalCase-&gt;groupByDepositionType();

        $this-&gt;set('pending_depositions', $pending_depositions);
        $this-&gt;set('cases', $cases);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>For those keeping score at home, that's one controller interacting with 4 different models.  You can have controllers that don't have any associated models.  You can also have controllers that don't talk to any model at all by default by setting the uses array to equal null.  So the idea of  Cake only being for simple "one table = one view" is simply wrong.  Again, I'd like to find a way to get rid of this idea that you can only have one model per controller.</p>

<h3>Cake's Ajax and Javascript helpers do not support graceful degradation</h3>

<p>I don't use the Ajax helper but a quick look at the online documentation shows that this myth might actually be true.  Core contributor Mark Story has a post showing you an example<a href="http://mark-story.com/posts/view/providing-contextual-form-help-with-mootools">how to make that happen</a> in CakePHP, but it requires a little bit of work.  Maybe Symfony is the only "mainstream" framework out there that has put effort into implementing that.  Personally, I don't use the Ajax helpers in Cake as I prefer to use jQuery.</p>

<h3>Cake's HTML and Form helpers produces bad markup</h3>

<p>I don't feel that's true at all.  The form helper can produce legends and fieldsets...and those can be turned off via parameters in the calls to that particular helper.  Again, more work needs to be done to clue people in about this stuff.  The online documentation does show what all the parameters that the helpers take do, so check them out to find out exactly how to bend if to your will.</p>

<h3>Unit tests are an afterthought</h3>

<p>Definitely not true.  When you use the 'cake bake' utility to create the outlines of models and controllers it also creates the empty unit tests that go along with it as well.  Cake also has a very extensive set of unit tests for the framework itself and code coverage that is up past 85% last that I had seen.  Testing is important, and it's good to see that Symfony also has a commitment to that.
</p>

<h3>CakePHP is not an "enterprise capable framework"</h3>

<p>
Could someone please tell me what this actually means?  Cake is used by Mozilla for their Add-ons site, so I think that's about as enterprisy a use as you're going to see out there.
</p>

<p>
So, a few myths about CakePHP busted I hope.  The thing I wish to emphasize to those who are looking at Cake to make sure they look at the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org">CakePHP Cookbook</a> and the <a href="http://api.cakephp.org/">online API documentation</a> in order to fully understand how to use the various helpers.

<h2>title: Communication Tools for Teams</h2>

<p>Being one of the lucky few who telecommutes full time.  You can drag my cold, lifeless body into an offirce, thanks very much.  So, the big issue that you face when telecommuting is how to talk to all your fellow co-workers.  Where I work, we use our own IRC server to not only talk to each other (we're spread across three time zones) but as front-line support for our customers as well.  This actually works out quite well, so I've been thinking about what other tools are helpful for this.</p>

<p>
In terms of just talking amongst yourselves, it seems that <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com">Campfire</a> has a lot to offer.  In fact, I would consider using it at work if we weren't running our own IRC server.  Via <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/">Giles Bowkett</a> I found out about <a href="http://propaneapp.com/">Propane</a>, a desktop client for connecting to Campfire.  Really cool stuff, and it makes me wonder what other options are out there.
</p>

<p>
An oft-neglected category of communication tools is messages about what has been worked on by the developers.  Me, I can't stand having someone coming around all the time asking me when I've finished what I'm working on.  As a result I decided to be proactive and configured post-commit hooks for our company SVN repositories.  So now any of us who do coding work commits something, we all get a nice email about it.  Since I've done that, we've been a lot more proactive about testing things because, well, you can no longer hide when you've made a change. ;)
</p>

<p>
As for bug and ticket tracking, well, we've got a homebrewed system (created before I got there) that I don't really like.  However, it is not going away so if I want to make any changes I will have to make them myself.  First thing I was thinking about was adding something to the post-commit hooks that will add a comment to the thread for particular ticket indicating you checked in some code that dealt with the ticket.  A common feature in things like trac I'm sure, but one I'd like to see in our own system.
</p>

<p>
Let me know in the comments what type of tools you use at your company.
