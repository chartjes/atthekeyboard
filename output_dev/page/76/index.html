<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>
C'mon ,you know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duran_duran">Duran Duran</a> kicks ass!  I was trying to think of a catchy title for a series of posts as I wind my way through the building of my first <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> app, using the <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> framework.  If you've used any other framework, you should be able to follow along with these posts as the concepts are all pretty much the same.
</p>

<p>
First off, I have great hopes that the <a href="http://tempdocs.cakephp.org">current CakePHP 1.2 manual</a> can morph into a resource as great as <a href="http://www.djangobook.com">The Django Book</a>, which looks to me to be the essential resource for anyone wishing to start off with Django.  Everything I'm doing at this stage in the project builds on what I've covered so far.</p>

<p>
Anyway, I've chose to build out Rallyhat, my sporting road planning site.  Much like when I build a <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> app, I start out with the models.  Django has a pretty good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> component, as compared to the associated data mapping model that CakePHP uses.  Now, to paraphrase from the Django book:  "introspection is hard", so in order to give the Model ORM some help you define the fields you will be using in your models.  Here are the definitions I'm using:
~~~
from django.db import models

class Sport(models.Model) :
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


class Team(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    sport = models.ForeignKey(Sport)
    city = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    state_province = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    country = models.CharField(max_length=30)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
                
                
class Game(models.Model):
    home_team = models.ForeignKey(Team, related_name='home_team')
    away_team = models.ForeignKey(Team, related_name='away_team')
    start_date = models.DateTimeField()
    sport = models.ForeignKey(Sport)
    
    
    def __str__(self):
        return '%s vs. $s' (self.away_team, self.home_team)

~~~
</p>

<p>
As you can see, I'm able to define all my fields I'm going to use with generic data types, and can even define the associations between the tables.  So, why do we do all this? Well, Django comes with some great CLI tools for helping you build stuff.  In fact, I dare say that you cannot build a Django application *without* using these tools.  Once you've defined the models you want to use, you validate the models using 'python manage.py validate', and it reports any problems it found.
</p>

<p>
While I was building this out, it told me that it couldn't determine the foreign keys I wanted, so I quickly figured out I had to put Sport first in the definition list, then Team, so that Game would know what to reference for the foreign keys.  It also told me that I had to set a 'related_name' attribute for my foreign keys in Game since I was reference the same model twice for a foreign key.  Very similar to how you can alias an association in Cake.
</p>

<p>
Okay, once that's done I can then get it to generate the actual SQL needed to create those models using 'python manage.py sqlall rh' (with 'rh' being what I'm calling the application within Django).  In this case I'm using a Postgres backend, so it generated SQL specifically for Postgres.
[sql]
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE "rh_game" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "home_team_id" integer NOT NULL,
    "away_team_id" integer NOT NULL,
    "start_date" timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
    "sport_id" integer NOT NULL
)
;
CREATE TABLE "rh_sport" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
)
;
ALTER TABLE "rh_game" ADD CONSTRAINT sport_id_refs_id_66e4cc9c FOREIGN KEY ("sport_id") REFERENCES "rh_sport" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
CREATE TABLE "rh_team" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "sport_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "rh_sport" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED,
    "city" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "state_province" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "country" varchar(30) NOT NULL
)
;
ALTER TABLE "rh_game" ADD CONSTRAINT home_team_id_refs_id_20e54e34 FOREIGN KEY ("home_team_id") REFERENCES "rh_team" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
ALTER TABLE "rh_game" ADD CONSTRAINT away_team_id_refs_id_20e54e34 FOREIGN KEY ("away_team_id") REFERENCES "rh_team" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
CREATE INDEX "rh_game_home_team_id" ON "rh_game" ("home_team_id");
CREATE INDEX "rh_game_away_team_id" ON "rh_game" ("away_team_id");
CREATE INDEX "rh_game_sport_id" ON "rh_game" ("sport_id");
CREATE INDEX "rh_team_sport_id" ON "rh_team" ("sport_id");
COMMIT;
[/sql]
</p>

<p>
Man, it creates the indexes too!  Okay, now that I'm happy with that all I have to is 'python manage.py syncdb' and it goes and actually creates the tables (and indexes) for me.  I took a look at the 'schema' task that exists for the Cake console (try 'cake schema' if you have already configured the console for use and poke around) and it will do similar things for you.  Nicely done, gwoo!

</p>

<p>
Bingo, presto!  We have our tables created for us!
</p>

<p>
I hope you've enjoyed this little glimpse into Django (and how it relates to CakePHP, in an obtuse way I guess).  Next time we invoke the spirit of Duran Duran, I'll be showing how I built a search form to find all games for a particular team, showing how Django's MTV (Model-Template-View) system works.

title: Simple User Registration in CakePHP 1.2
date: 2008-01-08</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>In the comments for my seemingly-popular post about using <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP's</a> Auth component (available in CakePHP 1.2), people have been having some questions about how the password is hashed and questions about a user registration system.  Of course, the snarky response is "go and read the source for Security::Hash() and create some of your own code", but it is easier to just give people some code so they stop asking.
</p>

<p>
I'm in the process of building out an admin area for my <a href="http://www.ibl.org">simulation baseball league</a> web site, and I created a registration system.  Here's a condensed version of it.
</p>

<p>First, I have my User model
<br />
~~~
<?php
class User extends AppModel {

    var $name = 'User';
    var $useTable = 'users';
}
~~~
</p>
</p><p>
Next, I created my controller for my users and the registration action for it
~~~
class UsersController extends AppController {
    var $name = 'Users';
    var $helpers = array('Html', 'Form');
    var $components = array('Auth');
    
    function beforeFilter() {
        $this->Auth->allow('register');
    }
        
    function register() {
        if (!empty($this->data)) {
            if ($this->data['User']['password'] == $this->Auth->password($this->data['User']['password_confirm'])) {
                $this->User->create();
                $this->User->save($this->data);
                $this->redirect(array('action' => 'index'));
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~
</p>
<p>
So, let's dissect this controller:
<ul>
<li>We're using the Auth component, set via "var $components = array('Auth')"
</li><li>We tell Auth to not ask for authentication when doing the 'register' action</li>
<li>When we detect data coming into the 'register' action (usually via a POST), then check to see if the hashed password that Auth has created from the 'password' field in our form matches the hashed value of the 'confirm password' field from our form</li>
<li>If all that is okay, we create and save our new user record</li>
</ul>
Yes, it really is that easy.
</p>
<p>
The form for this is very simple as well
<br />
~~~
<?php
echo $form->create('User', array('action' => 'register'));
echo $form->input('username');
echo $form->input('password');
echo $form->input('password_confirm', array('type' => 'password'));
echo $form->submit();
echo $form->end();
?>
~~~</p>

<p>
Throw all that stuff together and you now have a very simple user registration system.

title: How To HTTP-PUT A File Somewhere Using PHP
date: 2008-01-11</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>
A work project is getting close to 0.1 status.  Pretty underwhelming, I know.  One of the last 'milestones' for 0.1 is taking these wonderful XML documents that my web app creates (and stores in <a href='http://www.exist-db.org/'>eXist</a> and sends them to an internal web service that reads in the XML and breaks it apart for use by a wide variety of other company applications.  This web service will accept documents via an HTTP PUT (you know, GET, POST and it's neglected siblings PUT and DELETE) so I dug around a bit on the web (ignoring one cranky co-worker's complaints that real programmers read RFC's, or at least *know* what an RFC is) and put together some code</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<pre><code>    function _publish($service, $doc) {
        $params = array(
            'http' =&gt; array(
                'method' =&gt; 'PUT'));
        $context = stream_context_create($params);
        $fp = fopen($service, 'rb', false, $context);
        $response = fwrite($fp,file_get_contents($doc));

        if ($response === false) {
            return false;
        }

        // Pull out the status code from the header
        $metaData = stream_get_meta_data($fp);
        preg_match_all("/HTTP\/1\.[1|0]\s(\d{3})/", $metaData['wrapper_data'][0], $matches);
        $code = end($matches[1]);

        if ($code == 200) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
The only tricky thing here really is the use of the <a href="http://www.php.net/end">end</a> function to grab that last match of the status codes.  I got the code for doing the preg_match from <a href"http://www.jellyandcustard.com/2006/05/31/determining-if-a-url-exists-with-curl/">this site</a> and it seems to work just fine.  The reason to use end(...) as far as I can tell is to make sure that I only get the last match of the group.  Neat little trick and the link I posted demonstrates it.
</p>

<p>
I'm also quite proud that it's cURL free, as cURL seems to be the first option that most people use when doing this kind of thing.  There is some existing code that is using cURL that I *might* refactor to use the streams-driven stuff that I've been playing with.
