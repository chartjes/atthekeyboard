<h2>title: Deploying Applications</h2>

<p>Recently I have been told "Chris, you're a great developer but a terrible sysadmin."  Considering how often I muck-up the box that hosts my various web sites, there might be some truth to that.  So now I'm trying to be less of a sucky sysadmin and find solutions that both myself (and my poor friend Sean who cleans up my sysadmin messes).</p>

<p>When one of my employer's <a href="http://www.autoforums.com">new sites</a> was about to be launched one of the tasks I was given was to come up with an automated deployment system instead of the do-everything-by-hand system that we have in place now.  In-house, there was already a web-based tool that would export stuff from the CVS repository but anything else had to be done by hand.</p>

<p>Being a Rails fan, I had known about &lt;a href="//manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/97"">Capistrano</a> (used to be called Switchtower but they ran into some copyright issues on that name) but was unsure how it would work with a non-Rails app.  I did manage to hack something together but wasn't entirely happy with it.</p>

<p>In the end, the project had scaled down quite a bit (only one server instead of the three they had planned for) so the manual system is okay for now.  But I was still frustrated by not having an elegant, CLI solution to deploy the site.  I had toyed around with the idea of writing my own Capistrano clone for PHP (as source material for another I googled around some more today and found that Geoffrey Grosenbach (Rails guy and main force behind the Ruby on Rails podcast) &lt;a href="//nubyonrails.com/articles/read/460"">had done the same thing, but only better</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at that blog posting makes me realize that it's possible to use Capistrano to distribute PHP apps.  Wish this had been around at my old gig...</p>

<h2>title: Help Make SubEthaEdit Free!</h2>

<p>If you program on a Mac, maybe you've used &lt;a href="//www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/"">SubEthaEdit from CodingMonkeys</a>.  It's a cool text editing tool that lets you do collaborative editing.  I tried it once with some of my buddies and the three of us we hacked out some code all at the same time.  Really cool stuff.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="//maczot.com/"">BLOGZOT 2.0 on MacZOT.com</a> has decided to offer SubEthaEdit at a reduced cost.  <a href="//www.codingmonkeys.de/blog/articles/2006/04/25/maczot-blogzot-subethaedit-bargain-maybe-even-for-free-today"">Every person who blogs about it helps drive the price down</a>.  This means that MacZOT and TheCodingMonkeys will award $105,000 in Mac software if the price goes all the way down to zero. SubEthaEdit does syntax highlighting for all the major languages, and integrates with an FTP client of your choice to save your work on a remote server.</p>

<p>Blog about this and we can get a copy FOR FREE!.  Spread the wurd.</p>

<h2>title: Article over at tophosts.com</h2>

<p>At my <a href="http://www.verticalscope.com">current job</a> we also run a website for information about web hosting called <a href="http://www.tophosts.com">TopHosts</a>.  I did most of the form submission code in the background and integrated <a href="http://htdig.org">ht://Dig</a> with the articles that are up there.  I was asked to contribute a short article on PHP.  So I quickly whipped up <a href="http://www.tophosts.com/articles/002974.html">this article</a>.</p>

<p>Just a quick intro for people who don't know much about PHP.  They've asked me to contribute other articles down the road on the topic of PHP, mainly because the editor of the site liked my article in <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a> magazine.</p>
