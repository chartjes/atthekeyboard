<h2>title: Fun with API's -- FRAPI and django-tastypie</h2>

<p>Throughout my career as a programmer I've had moments that I call "why the hell didn't I see that earlier" moments when it comes to embracing new technologies and techniques.  The first such moment was when I discovered frameworks.  I mean, how many times did I write PHP apps with page and/or front controllers.  And all that mixing of business logic and display logic.  It was madness!
</p>

<p>
The next such time was when my friend Kevin convinced me to throw away my GUI shackles and learn to use the <a href="http://www.vim.org">One True Editor</a>.  Given how often the advanced features of the never-ending parade of IDE's I used were not being used, vim turned out to be exactly the tool I needed.
</p>

<p>
Well folks, I've had another one of these moments.  What is it?  Repeat after me:  THOU SHALL BUILD YOUR APPLICATION AS AN API FIRST, AND FRONT END SECOND.  I've been toying with this idea for a while, but a recent side project and these <a href="http://phpadvent.org/2010/first-class-apis-by-helgi-%C3%9Eormar-%C3%9Eorbj%C3%B6rnsson">three</a> <a href="http://phpadvent.org/2010/the-thing-with-the-two-heads-by-ed-finkler">awesome</a> <a href="http://phpadvent.org/2010/building-mobile-apps-with-php-by-jonathan-stark">articles</a> finally convinced me that my instincts were right, and that the extra work involved with API-first development (wow, maybe I've coined a new term) pays off in our new world of multiple devices wanting to slurp up online content.</p>

<p>
So, here are two tools that I think my readers should know about.  For those working with PHP, I cannot recommend enough the use of <a href="http://getfrapi.com">FRAPI</a> if you have a legacy application that you need to provide an API for.  Now, I will admit that the installation procedure is not for the faint-of-heart (you have to install packages via PEAR, PECL, and perhaps even adding packages for your operating system) but once you have it installed, you now have a tool to allow you to quickly create an API.  
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, FRAPI is a framework for creating a REST API.  Using the admin panel, you define the URL's you want for your API and it generates some code for you.  Then you edit the generated code to provide the actual output from your API, and reaction based on your GET/POST/PUT/DELETE request.   From when I downloaded it, it took me about 30 minutes to get FRAPI installed and create my first API call, including a customized output template.
</p>

<p>The documentation via the wiki isn't that great, but it gives you everything you really need to get started.  Kudos to the boys at <a href="http://twitter.com/echolibre">echolibre</a> for creating a super-useful tool.</p>

<p>
Now, if you're using Django there is an awesome add-on called <a href="https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie">django-tastypie</a> that allows you to quickly create a REST API for your Django models.  Again, from the time I downloaded it, it took me about 30 minutes to create an API for one of my models.  Now, I can create the front-end for the project either in Django or take the leap of faith and create it using Javascript and have it call the API.
</p>

<p>The documentation for django-tastypie is good, and <a href="http://joshbohde.com/2010/11/25/backbonejs-and-django/">this article on JS on the front, scripting language on the back</a> shows you a practical use for it.
</p>

<p>
So don't be afraid to build your application from the API out, now that there are plenty of tools to allow for easy integration with your application.

<h2>title: CodeMash 2011 Round-Up</h2>

<p>Despite a mini-snowpocalypse turning a 6-1/2 hour drive into an 8 hour drive, I made it to <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash</a> last week at the superamazingfantastic Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, OH.  I had my long-suffering wife and two girls with me and they enjoyed themselves at the water park (okay, I liked it too) and the arcade and the dry-land park.  In the meantime, I got my geek-on at the conference.
</p>

<p>
CodeMash was probably the largest conference I've ever been at, with between 700 and 1000 people attending based on comments from other people) and I'm also used to conferences that have a pretty narrow focus.  In this case, it appeared to me to be about 50% .Net stuff and 30% Ruby, the rest being things like a smattering of PHP and Python.
</p>

<p>
On the Wednesday night, there was a meet-and-greet for the speakers and sponsors in the hotel.  I went, ran into <a href="http://twitter.com/caseysoftware">Keith Casey</a>, had a few drinks and went back to the room.  Why?  Well, ever been to a party where everybody knew everyone else but you knew nobody?  That's what it felt like to me.  This isn't the fault of the conference organizers, more a reflection on how I like to interact with my fellow speakers.  Noisy bars aren't my favourite place to meet-and-greet people, and not knowing ANYONE there made me pause as I tried to figure out who to speak to etc.
</p>

<p>But once the conference got going, I warmed up to the idea and spent a lot of time speaking to people sitting at the same table as me for breakfast and lunch, as well as those near me in the talks I attended.  Due to the distraction of the kiddies ("Daddy, come to the water park with us!!!") I didn't get to see all the talks I wanted to do, but that was the price that had to be paid.  I thoroughly enjoyed Chad Fowler and Scott Chacon's keynotes, which got me thinking about my career and my current employer, and the steps required for happiness in said career.
</p>

<p>
I attended a talk about 3d printers (it was awesome, wish I had the $2K needed to buy one and all the tools required to keep it up and running), a talk on high-performance javascript (very informative, introduced me to the concept of non-blocking Javascript loading), a talk on the "modern open source development environment" (very disappointing, didn't cover anything that I was expecting to see about using Vim + Python|Ruby, more like a criticism of slow-running tests and using GUI editing tools), and I saw about 20 minutes of Keith's unit testing talk before a phone call from wife about car trouble took me away (it was nothing major, car was fine).
</p>

<p>
My talk went okay.  I covered all my material, had a good pace...but was about 10 minutes short.  Next time I give the talk I know exactly where I need to add more material.  Not too many questions during the talk itself, but some great questions AFTER the talk.  Again, more content for the talk itself.  For those who couldn't attend, you can find the slides <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/tdd-ci.pdf">here</a> and for those who don't mind hearing me talk (and drop a few swear-words) you can view a screencast in a wide variety of formats <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/BreakItBeforeYouBuyIt">here</a>
</p>

<p>
I will definitely be submitting again next year and will be making sure to venture out of my comfort zone and view some talks dealing with technology I don't really use much.  Also, I'll be sure to check out some of the ad-hoc open sessions if I don't happen to like the talks being offered being the conventional tracks.  Upon reflection, those would've been a perfect chance to expand my mind.
</p>

<p>
I want to personally thank <a href="http:/twitter.com/wjgilmore">Jason Gilmore</a>, one of the organizers of the conference (and the publisher of my CakePHP book) for treating me exceptionally well, and for taking time out of his super-busy schedule to talk about a joint strategy for 2011 for some projects we had been casually talking about.</p>

<p>
In short, I encourage people to check out CodeMash next year, I don't think you will be disappointed you went.

<h2>title: Smarter DB Migrations Using Zend Framework and Doctrine 1.2</h2>

<p>This posting is a lesson on the value of actually looking at the source code of a third-party library when you are trying to figure something out...</p>

<p>
I'm using Doctrine 1.2 for a Zend Framework project (loving the power of DQL) and I'm also big on continuous integration...which relies on being able to automate things.  Consequently, I was using Doctrine's <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/1.2/docs/manual/migrations/en">migrations</a> system to handle making changes to the database.  But I was frustrated.  The solution I had was running <b>each and every migration each time</b> and causing a lot of noise in the form of warnings about changes that had already been applied.  Was it hurting anything?  Just my pride and sense of Having Done Things Right.</p>

<p>So, I started searching around for solutions.  There seemed to be something missing in everything I found, some sort of smug assumption that the system was smart enough to know which migrations had already been done so you could double check.  Totally frustrated I decided to look at the source code for Doctrine itself...
</p>

<p>
"Hrm, this method seems to allow you to write a value to a table in a database...what table is that...goddamn it Chris, you are such a dumb-ass for not seeing this earlier!"
</p>

<p>I had noticed that there was a table in the database for this project called 'migration_version' but I kept ignoring it, thinking it was an artifact of an earlier attempt by me to implement roll-your-own migrations.  Little did I know that was the actual table I was supposed to use.  After some experimentation, I confirmed that I was indeed a dumb-ass and needed to start using this table properly.</p>

<p>
Next step was then to create a new PHP script to handle the migrations.  Keeping in mind that I'm using Zend Framework, here's what it looks like:
~~~
< ?php
define('APPLICATION_PATH', realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/application'));

if (!defined('APPLICATION_ENV')) {
    define('APPLICATION_ENV', (getenv('APPLICATION_ENV') ? getenv('APPLICATION_ENV') : 'testing'));
}

set_include_path(implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, array(
    realpath(APPLICATION_PATH . '/library'),
    get_include_path(),
)));
 
require_once 'Zend/Application.php';
 
$application = new Zend_Application(
    APPLICATION_ENV,
    APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini'
);
 
$application->getBootstrap()->bootstrap('doctrine');

Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance()->registerNamespace('Doctrine')->pushAutoloader(array('Doctrine', 'autoload'));  
$config = new Zend_Config_Ini(APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini', APPLICATION_ENV);
$manager = Doctrine_Manager::getInstance();  

foreach ($config->doctrine->attr as $key => $val) {
    $manager->setAttribute(constant("Doctrine::$key"), $val);  
}  

$migration = new Doctrine_Migration(APPLICATION_PATH . '/migrations');
$latestVersion = $migration->getLatestVersion();
$currentVersion = $migration->getCurrentVersion();

if ($latestVersion > $currentVersion) {
    echo "Migrating from v{$currentVersion} to v{$latestVersion}\n";

    try {
        $nextVersion = $currentVersion + 1;
        $migration->migrate($nextVersion);
        $migration->setCurrentVersion($latestVersion);
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage() . "\n";
    }
} else {
    echo "No migrations were performed\n";
}
~~~
I will explain the logic a little bit here
</p>

<p>
First, we have to do a bunch of stuff to load in our Zend Framework application.  I'm using autoloading of modules so I never have to worry about including something so long as I've followed the proper naming conventions.  Next, I create an instance of the Doctrine_Migration object, then determine whether or not we need to actually perform a migration by comparing the value in the 'migration_version' table to what the latest migration class says.
</p>

<p>
See, Doctrine is smart enough to look at all the classes you've written to do migrations and figure out which one is the latest.  The easiest way to do this is prefix the name of the file with a number, or if you are dealing with multiple developers you could go with YYYYMMDDHHMM or even a timestamp (if you're feeling l33t) as the prefix.  Anything you can do to make sure that the order of migrations is the way you want is good.  I went with a 4-digit number as the prefix.  We're currently at migration 0016.  I figure that if we get to 9999 migrations then I've probably done something wrong. ;)
</p>

<p>
Armed with the info about the last migration and the current migration, it's simple to determine if we actually need to run the migrations or not.  Problem solved in an elegant way, and no more unnecessary noise in the output from my continuous integration builds.
