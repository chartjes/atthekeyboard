<h2>title: New Trends In Front Ends</h2>

<p>Man, my blogging pace has slowed right down.  Not doing anything particularly exciting will do that to you. So, I thought I'd take a break from trying to diagnose a production-only bug (you know, the type of bug where the code runs perfectly in dev but doesn't work properly in production) that is mocking me, and taunting me while I feel the burn from starting the <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">100 pushups challenge</a> (damn you Twitter for the peer pressure!).  In case you're wondering, I am starting at rank 1 because I think I have the upper body strength of a man twice my age.</p>

<p>
Last week I wrote more Javascript code than PHP code, which is an interesting trend so it has me thinking about front end development a little more.  I still suck at interfaces (Rallyhat's UI is giving me analysis paralysis) but recent developments make me feel a little better.
</p>

<p>
In a previous post (not gonna self link, so search for it) I talked about why can't I have an all-Javascript back-end talking to an Erlang server.  Well, other than the fact that I don't know any Erlang I mean.  This is why projects like <a href="http://sproutcore.com">Sproutcore</a> have me excited.  Never mind the whole "Cocoa on the web angle" that a lot of people are talking up when describing it.  It's exciting because it is promoting a "back-end neutral" philosophy and emphasizing that people who ignore Javascript are turning their backs on a lot of good functionality.
</p>

<p>
Javascript + any back end that can spit out JSON is really what a Sproutcore application is.   I know the word paradigm shift is thrown out there a lot and is really overused, but I think the fact that something like Sproutcore is out there shows that web development itself is undergoing a shift.  I know that there are lots of examples of advanced Javascript + some back end in use (GMail, anyone?) but the fact that Sproutcore is getting some backing from Apple should tell you how important some people feel this type of application architecture could be.
</p>

<p>
It also simply reinforces my thoughts that knowing one language is no longer enough.  Just think of what you would need to understand in order to build something in Sproutcore using, say, CakePHP as the back-end:
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS (can't have those pages looking ugly, right?)</li>
<li>Javascript (although I'm wondering if jQuery and Sproutcore can co-exist)</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>SQL (have to be able to understand the queries being generated)</li>
<li>JSON (does that really count as a language or is it just encoding really?)
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>
The funny thing is that I now use this stuff without really considering that they are separate.  I just use 'em all, and abuse my relationships with people who are smarter than me to fill in the gaps.  It's the only way, really. :)
</p>

<p>
I believe Sproutcore is just the first of many Javascript application frameworks that will come out, so keep an eye peeled for the copycats and the "I did this because my problem is so unique that I could not use an existing solution" crowd.  The signal-to-noise ratio will be low, but worth wading through.

<h2>title: Namespaces in PHP?  Why <em>wouldn't</em> you want them?</h2>

<p>
Earlier today I say the following tweet on the-often-down-but-always-interested Twitter from <a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/">Matthew Weier-O'Phinney</a>:
<br /><br />
"What issues to _you_ see with using namespaces in PHP? Start blogging!"
<br /><br />
Since I am one who likes to share his opinion on a wide variety of topics, I thought this is a good one to prompt discussion.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespaces">Namespaces</a> are expected to be a feature in future releases of PHP.  I'm an outsider when it comes to tracking the going-on in the world of PHP internals.  So, because of that, I'm not going to comment on the actual syntax of how namespaces will be implemented or it's impact on internals.  That's not really important as far as this particular discussion goes.
</p>

<p>
Imagine if you will that you are the user of a <a href="http://cakephp.org">web application framework</a> that allows you to easily use third-party libraries by dropping them into a specific location in your application structure.  You go to use it and...what the fuck?!? Class name conflicts?!?!? ARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHH.  You proceed to post to  the mailing list for said framework, complaining bitterly about how you cannot use your favourite library with this stupid framework.  Some grumpy guy from Canada flames you in response and it spirals down from there into oblivion.
</p>

<p>
There are many programming languages that support namespaces, but PHP was not one of them.  Why are namespaces so important?  They can help to solve the exact problem mentioned in the paragraph above.  Why *wouldn't* you want such a thing?!?!  You can have 5 classes with the same name in 5 different namespaces and everything will be just fine.  Except for the fact you have 5 classes with the same name.  That's not good design, but namespaces would let you do that.
</p>

<p>
So, to go back to our little framework example for a minute, the framework could assign itself a namespace (oh, I dunno, like 'Cake') and if you happen to want to use a 3rd-party library with your application that has a class with the same name, it's all good...as long as you didn't put your own code in the same namespace.
</p>

<p>
So, to answer Matthew's original question:  I cannot think of any reason to NOT have namespaces in PHP.

<h2>title: Web Mockups, With A Hint Of Balsamiq</h2>

<p>(Disclaimer: after trying out the demo for this application, I discovered I could get a license for it by saying nice things on my blog.  I was ready to fork out the money for it though)</p>

<p>
I cannot be the only one useless at interface design.  I know my buddy and fellow patio-laying-at-my-house-worker <a href="http://lazyweb.ca">Kevin</a> is too.  While checking out <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> I came across this great application called <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Mockups</a>, which is cool AIR app (I use Ed Finkler's so-awesome-I-actually-use-it AIR Twitter client <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a>) for (shocking, I know) doing mockups of things.
</p>

<p>
When I saw this, I said (really) "Holy shit!!!".  And started to play with it.  And quickly realized that for people like me, this is the PERFECT tool for creating mockups of the sites I want to work on.  I agonize over sites when I'm building one from scratch, so much so that I feel the "paralysis from analysis" effect I have heard others talk about.  Don't believe me that it's this cool?  Check this demo out:
<br /><br />
<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/e7htdJCvkeQ&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/e7htdJCvkeQ&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
</p>

<p>
To me, the really cool thing is that it is also available as a plugin for some of the most well-known collaboration applications out there:  Confluence, JIRA and Twiki.  For me, the desktop version is just right, as I can take those mockups I create and export them as PNG's that I can then pass onto designers for comments and tweaking.  This is a sign of a developer who is <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html">"done, and gets things smart"</a>.
</p>

<p>
It costs $79, and for the frustrated programmer who wishes he could better as a designer, this is an amazing tool to add to your toolbox.  Go try it out and give him your money!
