<h2>title: Cake and AJAX</h2>

<p>Success!  I did manage to get the sortable grid working for the stats reporting system.  It was my first real example of creating an AJAX component for a work project.  It took me quite a while to figure some of the trickier things out.  I did use <a href=http://www.crackajax.net/grid.php>this excellent tutorial</a> to show me a basic example of implementing a sortable grid backed by data pulled from a SQL database.  After that, I found Graham Bird's excellent tutorial on <a href=http://grahambird.co.uk/cake/tutorials/ajax.php>creating an AJAX sortable task list with Cake</a></p>

<p>Now, what I did was a little more complicated because not only did I have to sort by the header columns in the table, I also had date ranges selected via a form <em>and</em> categories selectable via a form to take into consideration.</p>

<p>I can say this:  the AJAX helper functions for CakePHP are just fantastic and spared me from having to figure out all this stuff on my own.  I did have to create some stuff by hand in order to build the following little snipper:</p>

<p>body onLoad = "new Ajax.Updater('hiddenDIV','/verticalscope_stats/reports/getusers/site_name/99', {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, requestHeaders:['X-Update', 'hiddenDIV']}) }, false);"</p>

<p>Yikes.  Not the kind of stuff I want to be building by hand if I can avoid it.  Now, the Cake AJAX helpers use scriptaculous and prototype as the base for their actions.  I found a post in the wiki for Cake complaining about the large size of those two helper libraries, and they do have a point.</p>

<p>The post also turned me on to <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> , which describes itself as "... a Javascript library that takes this motto to heart: Writing Javascript code should be fun. jQuery acheives this goal by taking common, repetitive, tasks, stripping out all the unnecessary markup, and leaving them short, smart and understandable."</p>

<p>I have an idea to try and see if I can take a stab at creating my own Cake helper that uses jQuery instead of the awesome-but-quite-large scriptaculous+prototype combo for the AJAX stuff.</p>

<p>I plan on creating a tutorial on the stuff I did (specifically for implementing a sortable grid in CakePHP) in the next week or so.  It would be nice to share all the stuff I did. :)</p>

<h2>title: php|works Isn't That Far Off...</h2>

<p>...and I'm busy working on my talk "What can PHP Learn From Ruby On Rails".  I've been spending time on my train ride home putting together my magazine article for php|architect magazine on the same issue.  I've got 1500 of the requisite 4000 words done...and are trying to make sure that I'm staying on topic and creating something I will be happy about.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I've got another week or so to get the article done.  It's always an interesting process for me when writing an important document (whether it's a magazine article or a technical specification) as I often turn in stuff that I'm not happy with when I hand it in, but are happy with it when I actually read it after publication.  Too critical?  Maybe.</p>
