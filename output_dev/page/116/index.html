<h2>title: November Blogging Challenge - Day 1</h2>

<p><i>For the month of November I am going to be trying out an experiment.  I'm going to post Monday to Friday all November long.  The posts might be small.  They might be verbose.  They might cover topics you had no idea I was interested in.  But be ready.</i>
</p>

<p>
My friend <a href='http://twitter.com/chiggsy'>Kevin</a> is the one who introduced me to the world of <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> and his ability to get paid to build things using <a href="http://www.python.org">my new favourite language</a> fills me with envy.  He has also gone on (at length) to me in IM about why I should also be investigating <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU screen</a> to use as part of my toolkit.
</p>

<p>
See, I have this annoying habit of opening up multiple Terminal/Iterm sessions when I am doing things.  Most of the time, it's to quickly open up a session to a remote server.  I figure if I am going to do that sort of thing all the time, I should probably just bite the bullet and use screen's awesome ability to start up a session on a remote machine and then simply detach it.  Then, when I need access to that server again, just resume the session.  So simple, so of course it never occurred to me.
</p>

<p>
Given that I work in the shell so much (between vim and other CLI tools) it has become obvious to me that screen is a tool I should've been using for a long time, and only ignorance (or is it pride in doing things the wrong way ;) ) prevented me from investigating it.

<h2>title: Why I Love Stack Overflow</h2>

<p>One of the sites I find myself visiting more and more often is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.  The idea is so simple:  create a web site where people can ask questions and then allow other users to answer them.  Stack Overflow has spawned some other sites (most notably <a href="http://serverfault.com">Server Fault</a>, which helps sysadmins answer tougher questions) but I find it's origins much more interesting.
</p>

<p>
If I remember correctly, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</a> and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> started up Stackoverflow to provide a freely-available alternative to Experts Exchange.  I have lost track of the number of times I was searching for an answer on the web, only to be led to Experts Exchange and their requirement that you pay for access to an answer.  Jeff and Joel weren't having *any* of that, and thus Stackoverflow was born.  I'm sure it doesn't hurt that they have figured out how to make money off the site (they've started doing <a href="http://jobs.stackoverflow.com">job listings</a>, but it doesn't cost someone like *me* anything to make use of this amazing resource.
</p>

<p>
For example, this week I'm doing a refactoring of an application to rework many URL's to now include a publisher key along with a league key.  I discovered I needed to add a new field to a database table as part of the process, and long with that I also needed a migration script to go with it.  I didn't want to write a one-off script, so I started googling around to find an answer to the question "how to do a Postgres update script with multiple sub-selects".  After digging around for a while I suddenly realized I should ask an expert.  So off I went to Stack Overflow and asked for some help.  Then I went off to try a new sushi place in town for lunch.
</p>

<p>By the time I came back <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1668721/updating-records-in-postgres-using-nested-sub-selects">I had my answer</a>.  A well-thought-out, correct answer.  I tested it, worked just fine and I added it to the list of migration scripts for the upcoming code push when these changes go live.
</p>

<p>
I cannot recommend enough that you check out Stack Overflow next time you have a programming-related question that needs answering.  Also, be a good contributor and see if you can't help out some other users of the site by providing them with an answer for *their* question.  No, DIE IN A FIRE is not an appropriate response.

<h2>title: Don't Get Too Cute With Your Refactoring</h2>

<p>For those who follow me on Twitter, I'm pretty sure it was obvious I was having a very rough day today.  I'm in the process of making some pretty invasive changes to an application and work, and I approached it with much trepidation because of an extreme lack of tests.  I managed to get part one of these changes done, and refactored some stuff to get away from constantly passing parameters around like messages.  Instead I decided to place these values inside class variables.  Chortling to myself at how much better it was than passing the same values around all the time, I wrote some unit tests and all systems were green.  Awesome.</p>

<p>
Then I noticed the application itself didn't work properly now.  "How can this be, o seasoned veteran of 12+ years of web application experience?!?!" I can hear you saying.  Alas, forgive me for I have committed the sin of being too cute with my refactoring.
</p>

<p>
Well, actually, the problem is that I did not write enough tests to cover the code I was refactoring and simply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding">cowboy coded</a> my way through it today to get it to work.  Well, it's *sort* of working and there are many refactorings still to do.  But for sure I have to step back and examine my test coverage to make sure I am testing EVERYTHING I'm fixing.  The mistakes I made were SO obvious once I took the time to trace what I call the "call flow", which is tracking what gets executed and in what order.  If I had written tests for everything I encountered in this "call flow" I think I would've been a lot better off, instead of yelling obscenities targeted at myself while trying to figure it out.
</p>

<p>
Looking back at my choices in refactoring, well, I could've gone either way:  passing messages around in the form of parameters is a pretty safe way of doing things, but I'm determined to cut things down to the least amount of code possible while still achieving the desired results.  I'm not talking about non-intuitive code hacks, or using trinary expressions whenever possible.  If I'm using objects, I might as well use class variables to store values that need to persist throughout the request. 
</p>

<p>
So when I fire up <a href="http://www.vim.org">the one-true editor</a> tomorrow morning to keep going, I will say to myself out loud "don't get too cute with your refactoring, Chris.".  Oh yeah, and I'll make sure to write my tests as I go along.
