<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>11:03:17 AM 6161180: One of my personal projects coming up is a PHP5 web framework...prelude to a supersecret open source project
11:04:06 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: oh noes
11:04:08 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: a framework
11:04:31 AM 6161180: Yes, an evil framework
11:04:40 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: 99% of frameworks are
11:04:42 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: evil
11:04:51 AM 6161180: It's a tool to allow me to pimp myself out to various PHP conferences
11:05:00 AM 6161180: "How to build a PHP 5 framework that is not Evil"
11:05:09 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: step 1: download Cake.
11:05:14 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: there is no step 2!
11:05:50 AM 6161180: Cake is not ready
11:06:00 AM 6161180: it doesn't have any frosting yet
11:06:16 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: on the flip side, it mimics the best framework yet. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" />
11:06:27 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: mmm cake. now i'm hungry.
11:06:28 AM 6161180: There is some truth to that
11:06:35 AM 6161180: <strong>rummages around for a snack</strong>
11:06:43 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: the beauty of ruby on rails is how it is loosely coupled
11:06:55 AM 6161180: I dunno...a lot of stuff I do now are exercises to expand my own programming skillz
11:06:58 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: it doesn't make doing things a different way any harder
11:07:11 AM 6161180: maybe it's time I looked at cake closely
11:07:20 AM 6161180: and abandoned my crazy dreams
11:07:39 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: i'm not convinced that php's design as a language really allows the creation of a good framework
11:07:58 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: it's missing a lot of important higher-level language features
11:07:58 AM 6161180: I don't see why not
11:08:03 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: meta-programming's practically impossible 
11:08:20 AM 6161180: what do you mean by "meta-programming" in this instance?
11:08:28 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: writing code which writes code on the fly
11:08:40 AM 6161180: you're talking about the generator scripts?
11:08:45 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: no.
11:08:47 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: let me show you.
11:10:03 AM sp1ffar1ff1c:    {:up =&gt; :move_higher, :down =&gt; :move_lower, :top =&gt; :move_to_top, :bottom =&gt; :move_to_bottom}.each do |action, list_method|
   define_method(action) do
        if params['id']
              @section = Section.find(params['id'])
              @section.send(list_method)
        end
        redirect_to :action =&gt; 'list'
      end
    end<br />
11:10:30 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: this bit of code writes methods when the class is invoked. it's not inside another method, it's just in the class. 
11:10:46 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: the fancy thing is a closure
11:10:57 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: closures + metaprogramming = simplicity
11:11:12 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: it was paul graham who really made me see that ther ereally is a huge power difference between languages
11:11:28 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: he of course pushes lisp, but ruby has most of the features which make lisp great, without the horrible dialects. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" />
11:12:26 AM 6161180: I guess the biggest problem is that PHP grew so fast
11:12:32 AM 6161180: hard to go back after the fact and clean up the mess
11:12:47 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: the biggest problem is that it was made by a guy who hates to program and design things. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" /> php is a sledgehammer.
11:12:51 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: but sometimes you need finer tools
11:13:06 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: it's still the best out there vs eveyrthing but ruby
11:13:07 AM sp1ffar1ff1c: for web dev</p>

title: My first steps towards open source
date: 2005-10-05</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>Tomorrow I'm starting some work on my supersecretsideproject, which is going to be an open source project.  I've never done any code that I've given away under open source, only paid stuff.  Many moons ago I wrote a system to interface with Canada Post's eParcel system, and I managed to sell a copy of it for good coin too.</p>

<p>At the time I got a few emails from people hoping to get it from me for free.  Since I was woefully underemployed at the time (my first foray into the world of freelance work) I didn't want to lose out on any money.  So of course I said no to people.  Only ever made the one sale, and that code is long gone.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to make up for previous stupidity now and create something that more than just one person will want to use out there on the internet.  I'll keep you posted on how it goes.</p>

title: PHP Frameworks...are they worth the trouble?</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>My open source project has gotten underway, as the three conspirators met and hashed out how we wanted the view/template part of the system to work.  We got to play around with <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> and it's great collaborative capabilities.  It was cool to see me edit something in the document, then the <a href="http://www.derekmartin.ca">other guy</a>, and then <a href="http://www.jobblender.com">our other partner</a> add in his info.  You should seriously check it out sometime.</p>

<p>But I've started to wonder if <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> hasn't, well, spoiled me.  When I think about how to implement Rails in PHP (although <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">Cake</a> is trying), I realize that I don't know if it could be done as slickly as Rails was done with Ruby.  Doing a half-assed web application framework is easy.  Doing a good one is hard.</p>

<p>And on top of this all, Zend annoucned their new <a href="http://www.zend.com/collaboration/">PHP Collaboration Project</a> which, at this time, consists of working with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> to make it easier to do PHP dev work with it (Zend Studio 6 maybe?), and...a PHP framework.  Open sourced.  Blessed for use in the "enterprise".</p>

<p>So, maybe the second part of the Grand Project must wait until we take a look at what Zend comes up.  I can't help but wonder if <a href="http://http://www.xisc.com/">this little project that won a Zend programming contest</a> is what will become the Zend PHP Framework...</p>
