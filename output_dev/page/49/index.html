<h2>title: Blog Roundup</h2>

<p>I normally don't talk about other blogs that I like to read, but I decided this might be a nice time to share some of them
<ul>
<li><a href="http://yarivsblog.com">Yariv's Blog</a> is the blog of programmer Yariv Sadan.  He's doing a lot of work to bring Erlang to the web via his <a href="http://erlyweb.org/">ErlyWeb</a> web framework.  Why do I keep coming back?  Part of me wants to build something in Erlang because it can handle the type of high concurrency, synchronous web applications that Web 2.0 seems to be pushing us towards.</li>
<li>Jamis Buck has three Ruby-related blogs I like to go to: <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/">the { buckblogs :here }</a>, he contributes to <a href="http://blog.caboo.se/">~:caboose</a> and he also contributes to <a href="http://www.therailsway.com">The Rails Way</a>, where they take user submitted code and suggest refactorings for it.  Jamis is one of the smartest guys I've ever come across on the web, so I never hesitate to take a look at what he's talking about.</li>
<li>I find myself going to the <a href="http://www.whenpenguinsattack.com">Jaslabs</a> high-performance PHP page more and more often these days.  Great articles and tips for the more advanced programmer.  You can always use some help.</li>
<li>My friend Amy Hoy runs <a href="http://slash7.com">Slash7</a> where she talks about her experiences with Rails and user interfaces.  Oh yeah, go buy her Javascript book when it comes out!</li>
<li>If you're into CakePHP at all, go visit <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org">ThinkingPHP and beyond</a> where Felix will give you some insight into the inner workings of the CakePHP web framework</li>
</ul>

<h2>title: Packing My Bags And Moving On</h2>

<p>Many years ago when I worked for a company that went under while I was still working there (I was tossed overboard by being laid off along with other employees who didn't happen to own any stock in the company) I vowed to myself that I will always know when it was time to go.  To not stick around when the signs around you point to leaving.  That time has come for me at my current job with <a href="http:/www.verticalscope.com">VerticalScope</a></p>

<p>
I handed in my two weeks' notice yesterday morning to my boss.  He seems to be taking it very well, congratulating me on finding a new job that works out better for me.  He says I will be missed.  While the cynic in me rolls it's eyes and thinks this is less than sincere, I do appreciate being told that.  I have enjoyed my time at the 'Scope but I have found a job I just couldn't turn down.</p>

<p>
I had been looking recently to change jobs for two reasons:  reason #1 was to move into a job with a leadership position, reason #2 was to try and find something closer to home.  Through my friend <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> I found out that <a href="http://www.iloverewards.com">iloverewards</a> was hiring PHP developers.  I went to a job fair after work one day.  I had some interviews over lunch.  I received a job offer.  And then something happened.</p>

<p>The day after I got the job offer, I received an email from Cal Evans, the editor of <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">Zend Developer Zone</a>.  He knew what was going on with me, but said that he knew someone else who was looking to hire a PHP developer and that even though I had an offer I should at least listen to what this person had to say.  The person?  Daniel Kushner.  Ex-Zend employee, he was now working for <a href="http://www.syneron.com">Syneron</a> in their e-business unit.  2 phone conversations.  A nice lunch.  And another job offer.</p>

<p>There's that old song "Did you ever have to make up your mind?".  I was seriously stressed.  The iloverewards offer was a senior one, a chance to spearhead development and lead a team of inexperienced developers through the madness of development.  Just the type of challenge I was looking for.  But the one from Syneron, well, I couldn't pass it up.  Work from home 3 days a week.  Work on some very different things in the medical field.  Travel to California once a month.  Daniel works from home as well, so I imagine there will be lots of phone calls and text messages (maybe I need to upgrade my phone to a Crackberry now?)  Travelling an hour by car to the office twice a week is better than the 90 minute+ commute I currently have via public transit.  I'll be a lot more relaxed, and better able to focus on the tasks at hand.  As supportive as my boss at VerticalScope was about letting me work from home on occasion (and super understanding about family issues), they couldn't match that.</p>

<p>
So, I'm very excited for the opportunity to work with Daniel and the e-business unit there as we go into uncharted territory when it comes to the health industry and the use of modern web technology.  I'm going to be trying to solve some very interesting problems for a group of people who really don't know much about technology, and don't really care what technology is being used.  It just has to work.</p>

<p>
So, I start at the new job March 12th.  Wish me luck!  And Derek, I'm sorry it didn't work out for me coming to work with you.  Maybe somewhere else down the road we hook up again.</p>

<h2>title: Still No New Code To Report...</h2>

<p>I've been feeling "meh" this week.  Winding down my last two weeks at my <a href="http://www.verticalscope.com">current job</a> and getting ready to work at my <a href="http://www.syneron.com">new job</a> (by the way, Doron Gerstel, the president of the company, sent me flowers(?!) as his way of welcoming me to the company.).</p>

<p>
So, I thought I'd talk about a few completely random things:
<ul>
<li>My <a href="http://www.lisahartjes.com">sister</a> is doing a webcomic called <a href="http://dominogirls.lisahartjes.com/">Domino Girls</a>.  She's writing, while someone else is doing the artwork.  Trust me, my sister can't draw but she's a pretty good writer</li>
<li><a href="http://cake.insertdesignhere.com/">Nate</a> has been doing a lot of work on some stuff for CakePHP so that my interactive console will actually work.  Once I get my hands on my new laptop (17" MacBook Pro, baby) I'll be able to do more work on that.</li>
<li>I got feedback on the talk I gave at the Vancouver PHP Conference 2007.  It was given a 7.4 out of 10 by those who took the survey.  As I suspected, I was talking too fast and not showing enough PHP-based answers.  Now I know how to chop down the number of slides from the high 50's to the low 40's like I wanted...</li>
<li>The rush is on the get the component <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> and I have been doing for the Zend Framework done.  What's left?  Proper documentation (yay Derek!), remove a deprecated object from our component (Zend_Service_Rest) and replace it with the proper one (Zend_Rest_Client) and then figure out exactly which unit tests need to go and which can stay as there is some confusion about what sort of tests are needed for a totally web-based component.</li>
<li>Saw that the Pragmatic Programmers are publishing a <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/">book about Erlang</a>.  Hrm...for once has my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMan#Powers_and_equipment">spidey sense</a> about technology caught a sniff of something before it hits big time?  Paging <a href="http://yarivsblog.com">Yariv Sadan</a></li>
<li>I'm getting a referral bonus from VerticalScope if the guy they just hired (junior programmer, will be working on <a href="http://www.tophosts.com">TopHosts</a> makes it through his 90 day trial period.</li>
<li>If you like cool war movies, I highly suggest you check out 300, a movie based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, which is based on the real story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae">the Battle of Thermopylae</a>, where 300 Spartan and Thespian warriors held off the Persian Army long enough for the rest of the Greek army to get away, fighting to the death.  I love Wikipedia for things like this.</li>
