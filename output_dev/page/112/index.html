<h2>title: So You Want To Telecommute? Part 2 - Accountability</h2>

<p>In <a href="http//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2009/07/29/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-1-building-trust">part one</a> of this series, I talked about the integral role that trust plays in telecommuting.  Next up we need to talk about the tools you're going to need in order to show accountability while telecommuting.</p>

<p>
When I accepted my telecommuting position, the first thing that happened was that I immediately felt less-stressed because I no longer had my 90 minutes in / 120 minutes out commute to deal with.  For many, that is the number one reason they want to work from home.  Then, I realized that I would also be in an environment where I would be able to control the distractions.  In previous jobs, it was that inability to shut out the distractions when I needed to was the problem. 
</p>

<p>In your typical developer cube-farm, there is zero chance that you can find some quiet and solitude when you need it.  All I ever wanted was an office where I could close the damn door when I needed to Get Things Done.  C'mon, you think putting on your headphones is enough to drown out the world around you.  Perhaps it's because I am a grumpy old man, but that just won't cut it.
</p>

<p>
However, you cannot work in isolation when telecommuting for a company, as opposed to freelancing.  There are fellow employees that you will need to speak with, probably on a regular basis.  Telecommuting is not for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy">misanthropes</a> who dream of long stretches of uninterrupted work.  You *will* be asked to prove that you're working, not sitting on the couch playing video games when you're supposed to be debugging that new Ajax-powered user interface.  Just pushing your code into production isn't enough.
</p>

<p>We have our own home-brewed ticketing system that started out as a way for clients to inform us of issues they are having, or requests for changes to the services we deliver to them.  Since I have been here (some of it at my prompting), it has also branched out into bug and feature tracking for our various internal projects.</p>

<p>
Also, another reason for it is accountability.  While our clients (obviously) cannot see the tickets for internal projects, we can see each other's tickets.  Clients are also able to see every entry in the tickets system related to their issues.  During our weekly staff meeting (more on the format for that in the next installment) we discuss "dangling tickets", which are issues that have not been resolved in a timeframe that we are comfortable.  Without a transparent issue-tracking system, it would be too easy to try and deny accountability when stuff isn't getting done.
</p>

<p>
Just using email for this sort of thing is, in my opinion, a mistake.  It's too easy to say "I didn't get that email" or "I must've missed that email".  If you're not tracking your outstanding issues in a way that others can't see, you're asking for trouble as a telecommuter.  Sure, not everything we do goes into that issue tracking system.  But anything that's critical to your ability to get your assigned tasks done, you have to let other people know what you're doing.  Otherwise you have no justification for asking for help, or even re-prioritizing your tasks.
</p>

<p>
So, with your issue-tracking system in place you can now start delving deeper into fine-tuning your work flow.  If your issue-tracking system can keep track of the dates when issues were generated and then resolved, you can get an idea of your velocity on tasks.  Then the next time you need to do something very similar, you can tell your boss with confidence how long it will take you next time.  Now you can get back to playing vid...I mean, get back to planning your next task.
</p>

<p>Also, knowing how long things will take to do, with a good level of accuracy, lets you give your boss surprising bits of information like "Hrm, ticket 3478 is like an older ticket I did a few months back.  I should be able to get that finished 2 days ahead of the current schedule, so I've got time to tweak that automated deployment task that's flagged as low personal priority.  Okay if I get that working today and Friday?"
</p>

<p>
Yes, things like this can and do happen.  In fact, I try to make sure that I keep an eye on lower-priority tasks that can be pushed up in priority if I happen to get something done ahead of schedule.  Not every task in my list is labeled "high priority", which is something I blame  my boss for :)
</p>

<p>
Next up, I will share my experiences with staying in touch with your fellow workers while maintaining sanity in your work flow.</p>

<h2>title: So You Want To Telecommute? Part 3 - Collaboration</h2>

<p>(This is part 3 of an ongoing series about my experiences with telecommuting and the tools and practices I feel help make it work)</p>

<p>This post has a little bit of crossover with <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2009/08/01/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-2-accountability/">second post</a> in this series, so you'll have to forgive me if you see something I talked about before.  Now that's we've identified the issues of trust and accountability, the next big issue a telecommuter faces is one of collaboration.
</p>

<p>
So now that you've gotten an environment created where you are being trusted to do your work as assigned (despite what people think, just doing a good job isn't always enough in the minds of those who manage programmers and designers), and you have a way to be held accountable for the stuff you are working on, we are on to the sticky issue of collaboration.
</p>

<p>
As an aside, it is important to understand that if your company creates things that other people use, there is a big difference between how you communicate with your customers and how you communicate with your co-workers.  You might consider me cynical, but your communications with your customers need to be in such a way that you have control over the channels.  Otherwise you open yourself to chaos and miscommunication.  Although we do have email addresses used for support, we are consistent in our messages to our customers that we need them to use the ticketing system.  Otherwise they run the risk of having their problems not dealt with in a timely manner.
</p>

<p>
Internally, our main method of collaboration is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc">IRC</a>.  We have our own server, and we use IRC as the second line of support for our clients, encouraging them to log in and join us in IRC for problem solving sessions that just can't be done via email.  We all stay logged into our main company channel and usually logged in to the main support channel.  By having one central location where we hang out online, it allows us to (a) log all conversations for later review and (b) allow digging find solutions we talked about earlier but never turned into internal tickets.
</p>

<p>
However, I do find that the nature of IRC at work is much like instant messaging: it creates an air of perpetual interruption.   Luckily, there are easy ways to deal with the problem.  My <a href="http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus">IRC client</a> lets me set alerts for messages.  I have it chirp out very loudly whenever someone in IRC types my name in a message.  That way, I can concentrate on coding and then shift over to IRC when my attention is required.  Otherwise, you would be forever checking the chat window to see if I need to deal with anything.
</p>

<p>
If we didn't already use IRC (it was being used before I got here) I would recommend using something like <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a>.  It's a good mix between IRC and instant messaging, and you can find some <a href="http://www.karppinen.fi/pyro/">interesting</a> <a href="http://propaneapp.com/">clients</a> for it if you don't want to use a web-based interface.  I imagine the only bad thing is that someone else is storing logs of your conversations.  Personally, I don't worry about that sort of thing since it's very unlikely anyone who really cares about what you're doing will see those conversations.  Plus, it is not free but I think the service is worth it.
</p>

<p>
What you use isn't really important, so long as you're using something that allows everyone to be in one location and that you can log what's been talked about.  The ability to easily share ideas and links is critical.  To me, email lacks the immediacy that a telecommuter who has to collaborate with his workers on a regular basis needs.  Plus, emails are way too easy to ignore.  How many times has a colleague who you suspected didn't want to do something for you claimed "I never got that email."
</p>

<p>
So typically we will discuss things in IRC, then follow-up with either internal tickets or emails that draw in people outside the company if required.  There is the odd conference call for myself, but my co-workers seem to have more of them than I do.  Our weekly meetings are done in IRC as well, eliminating the need for what would likely be a time-wasting 7-person conference call full of stops and starts and dropped calls.  IRC for the win!
</p>

<p>
I'm sure I've only scratched the surface of collaboration for remote workers, but I think if you make it an early priority to have a communications method where all workers can hang out without giving it their constant 100% attention, then you will find a more natural workflow will emerge.  For telecommuters, it's all about the work flow.

<h2>title: "So You Want To Telecommute? Part 4 -- Programming Tools"</h2>

<p>(This is the 4th part in series about my experiences as a telecommuting developer.  For more info, check out <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2009/08/08/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-3-collaboration/">part 3, </a><a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2009/08/01/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-2-accountability/">part 2</a>, and <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2009/07/29/so-you-want-to-telecommute-part-1-building-trust/">part 1</a>)</p>

<p>
If you really want to set of a flame war on the internet, start talking about what you use as (a) your programming language and (b) what editor / IDE you use.  Thankfully, this posting is not about either one of those things.  After all, who can argue with using <a href="http://www.vim.org>the One True Editor</a>.  Here, I want to share my thoughts on the type of tools you are likely to need as a telecommuting developer.
</p>
<p>
So now that you've gotten the trust of your employer, and you have tools in place to provide accountability, and have a system in place to collaborate with your fellow employees (hah, tied those all together nicely!) we now have to talk about what you are going to use to get the job done.  
</p>
<p>
Chances are that if you are telecommuting, you are working for a small company.  Which also means that it is very likely that you will doing a lot more than just writing your code and handing it off to someone else for deployment into production.  When you also take into account that response times for your fellow telecommuters is likely slower than if you were in the same office, you almost needs to put into place practices that are defensive in nature.
</p>
<p>
The importance of a reliable set of development tools is something I've touched upon both in previous posts on this blog and in talks I've given.   This toolset becomes even more important when you're responsible for getting your code into a state where you can deploy it with confidence.  There is a reason that the amount of information available about unit testing, continuous deployment, and tools for automating other parts of the development process has exploded lately:  they are all things that can help you get error-free code deployed faster.
</p>
<p>
Many do not believe in the Cult of Unit Testing, and that's okay.  There are lots of other testing that can be done.  Even something as simple as testing things out in a browser can become a critical part of your programming toolkit.  I'm sure it comes as no shock to people how many bugs slip through the development process and into production that could've been detected with a simple check of the application via a web browser.  We are all guilty of this kind of thing.  These days thanks to things like <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> and <a href="http://www.getwindmill.com/">Windmill</a> it is easier than ever to create scripted web browser sessions for testing purposed.  
</p>
<p>
Sure, it will take time to learn to use these tools but it's hard to argue that it is anything other than (a) laziness or (b) fear of the unknown in the form of other languages or environments that stops people from implementing tools that will give you such a huge return on the investment made into setting them up.  I have been guilty of this in the past too, so I'm familiar with the anxiety that accompanies the attempt to automate parts of your testing.
</p>
<p>
So with some sort of testing in place, the next step is to get into place automated deployment tools.  Readers of my blog know my fondness for <a href="http://www.capify.org/index.php/Capistrano">Capistrano</a>, and it's use has become an integral part of my toolkit.  Why?   It allows me to do automated *repeatable* deployments to both my staging and production environments.  I work very hard to eliminate the idea that "we need to do things differently in production", because you can pretty much guarantee that you will end up with bugs that only exist in production and are difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate in your development environment.
</p>
<p>
I am not aware of any tools like Capistrano that exist for those who use Windows as their production stack.  If you know of some, let me know in the comments.  For my friends who use PHP and cannot use Ruby, I highly recommend investigating the use of <a href="http://phing.info/trac/">Phing</a> as a substitute.  I've also been playing around with <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/fab/">Fabric</a> as an alternative to Capistrano.  Much as with testing, there is no shortage of tools available to you.  Heck, even something as simple as shell scripts that check out your code from version control and copy it into a desired location are a step up from manual deployment of code.  Sure, it's easy to do 'svn update' in a directory, but that will only be easy until you have to start doing things like database changes at the same time.
</p>
<p>
I guess what I'm really trying to say is that you should be using tools that make deploying error-free code into production *easier*, because chances are you will be the one doing the deployment.  Where I work, each developer is responsible for deploying their own code so it was in my best interest to create something that was "fire and forget" when it came to pushing up changes.  Need to copy new scripts in place for pulling data from our XML db?  No problem.  Need to update the schema for the database?  No problem, got it totally covered.
</p>
<p>
A lot of these issues are something I've covered <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2008/04/17/deployment-is-not-a-4-letter-word-the-screencast/">before</a>.  Instead I will focus on a final thought on tools -- they need to be as easy to use as possible.
</p>

<p>
When you telecommute, one of the biggest problems is response time.  Since you're not in the same office (or even same city) as your co-workers, when something goes wrong it is likely that you will have to be the one that fixes it without help from others.  Building a tool kit like the one I've suggested will go a long way towards helping you when things go wrong.  Which they will.  By automating as much of this as possible, it becomes quite simple to fix any problems.
</p>

<p>
If you have to fight against your tools, then I think you're doing it all wrong.  Surround yourself with tools that you are comfortable using, and understand just how essential they really are.  When I think of how I used to program when I started 12 years ago, I have no idea how I got anything substantial done.  With my tool set in place, I'm ready to tackle just about anything I need to do at work.  My ability to customize the tools I use means I can do my job from anywhere I can get a reliable internet connection.  And that is really the key to successful telecommuting:  getting things done so they won't ever ask you to come into the office again.
</p>
