<h2>title: Static Members</h2>

<p>As I work on code using the Zend Framework for a project at work (a stats reporting system for all our forums) I noticed that a lot of static class methods are being used instead of calling them dynamically:</p>

<pre><code><br />&lt;?php
$db = Zend_Db::factory('pdoMysql', $params);
Zend::register('db', $db);
$view = new Zend_View();
$view-&gt;setScriptPath('../app/views');
Zend::register('view', $view);
$controller = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
?&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>So i said to myself "why are we using these static class calls instead of dynamically creating instances of these classes?".  Little did I know that I had stumbled upon another one of the Great Holy Wars of Programming:  static vs. dynamic.</p>

<p>Not only does this war cover static typing vs. dynamic typing for languages (PHP uses dynamic typing), but it also covers the use of static methods vs. instance methods.  50+ messages in the thread later and we're nowhere closer to solving the problem.  All I wanted to know was why we were doing it this way, and as a secondary goal to try understand when we need to do it dynamically (when the state of the object is important) and when to call an object method statically (when the state of the object that the method belongs too is not important).</p>

<p>My thanks to Ralph Shindler for pointing me at <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2001-11/03-qa-1121-mrhappy.html">this little gem</a> that tries to explain the static method vs. instance method problem.  This is one area of OOP that I hadn't paid much attention to since I had heard "static bad, dynamic good" back in my very early OOP days.  Like everything else, there is a place for static methods and a place for instance methods.</p>

<p>One of the common reasons to NOT use static methods was that it can make unit testing difficult.  Of course, you could always wrap the call to the static method so that it comes off as an instance method in your code, but that is a topic that is left to more experienced OOP developers.</p>

<p>As an aside, I've pretty much settled on the outline for the talk I'm going to be giving at php|works.  Now I'm working on some code snippets involving the Zend Framework to illustrate just what the heck I'm talking about.</p>

<h2>title: Thoughts About My Upcoming Talk</h2>

<p>As you can see from the graphic in the upper-right-hand corner of my blog, the php|works conference isn't that far off.  I've been working on the outline for my talk "What Can PHP Learn From Rails?" and have settled upon the basics for it.</p>

<p>But it begs a bigger question:  is it possible to take what is really great about Rails (and by definition that means some great features of Ruby) and make it work in PHP?  When going to my friend <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek's</a> goodbye party (he's switching jobs to work for a company next door to his old one) I was talking to my old co-workers about my talk.  And they raised a good question: what are PHP's strengths.</p>

<p>I opened my mouth to say something and then closed it.  Maybe it was the beer that made me pause.  I'll be honest:  I really like Ruby and there are some really neat things being done.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with being able to duplicate a lot of what Rails is doing is, well, PHP isn't Ruby.  Ruby's method of treating everything like an object is something that PHP just can't do.  ActiveRecord in Ruby works so well because Ruby can examine it's own properties (I believe that is called reflection), and ActiveRecord takes full advantage of that.  One of the thrusts of my talk is that developers who are creating tools for other developers to use (I'm not talking about creating applications) have to use the strengths of PHP instead of railing (heh) against PHP's perceived limitations.</p>

<p>I've probably posted things like this before, but ActiveRecord is able to do things like this:</p>

<pre><code><br />person = new FamilyMember
data = person.find_by_last_name_and_sex('Hartjes', 'female')

</code></pre>

<p>Without me doing <em>anything</em>, ActiveRecord knows to translate this into "SELECT * FROM familymembers WHERE last_name = 'Hartjes' AND sex = 'female'</p>

<p>Can you do that in PHP? I do know that <a href=http://www.cakephp.org>CakePHP</a> (which has been getting lots of favourable reviews) has their own ActiveRecord implementation.  Can it do the above?  Not quite yet.  It does handle something like this: (taken from the CakePHP website):</p>

<pre><code><br />$this-&gt;Post-&gt;findByTitle('My First Blog Post');
$this-&gt;Author-&gt;findByLastName('Rogers');
$this-&gt;Property-&gt;findAllByState('AZ');
$this-&gt;Specimen-&gt;findAllByKingdom('Animalia');

</code></pre>

<p>I can see how this behaviour would be easier to implement in PHP 5, and I will have to take a look at CakePHP to see how they do it in PHP 4.  With a little bit of effort I'm sure you can add multiple terms to a PHP ActiveRecord implementation to mimic how ActiveRecord works in Ruby.</p>

<p>We, as PHP developers, should hesitate to take good ideas from other programming languages and see if there is a way to make an implementation that is just as easy to use as the original.  Object Relational Mapping works not just with ActiveRecord in Ruby, but with other items in Ruby as well.  I saw a slide show of David Heinemeier Hansson's presentation he gave at a Ruby conference in Japan.  He showed an item called ActiveResource that acts just like ActiveRecord but will work on all sorts of things.</p>

<p>Where are the people who are creating things like that in PHP 5?  Maybe people are doing that work, but they aren't as eager to share that info with the rest of the world as DHH (and the rest of the Rails crowd in general).  Maybe this is what happens when the core group of people working on a language gets to the point where one person can't drive the language my the sheer will of their ego.  This isn't a bad thing, by any means.  It shows that PHP has gotten a huge level of acceptance and that there are now many people capable of contributing to it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I should save some of this for my presentation instead of sharing it on the blog. :)</p>

<h2>title: Back At The Keys</h2>

<p>I'm sure my more diligent readers have noticed a lack of posting for two weeks.  I'm back from a vacation with the family in St. Louis (visiting my brother-in-law).  I had a great time, despite the insanely-long 15-hour drive from Canada to St. Louis across the midwest.  I can't imagine doing that trip all the time like some long-haul truckers do.</p>

<p>So anyway, I'm taking some time next week to tweak the outline for my upcoming talk (it's only two months away) at php|works to figure  out where (and more important what they will be) to put the coding examples designed to illustrate ideas from Rails and how they could apply to PHP.</p>

<p>My buddy <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> is enthused about his new job.  I winced a bit when I saw him burning some bridges at his old work with his comments, but given the way he had been treated since I left the company I'm not surprised by it.  Welcome back to the world of actually creating things, Derek. :)</p>

<p>I've been working on a stats reporting system at work with the Zend Framework and it's been going well.  I'm right on schedule and expect to deliver a beta version for testing and comments by Wednesday of next week.  I found that doing all the unit tests have also revealed some errors I wouldn't have thought to look for.</p>

<p>I'm also spending some time to day taking another stab at using Eclipse as my development environment.  Despite the lack of a working SFTP plugin, I can see how the benefits outweigh the annoyance of not being able to copy the files to the server.</p>

<p>Besides, I've started using my iBook as my development environment more and more.  Which is a good practice to get into, as I learn techniques for generating data sets for testing and making sure my code is portable across environments.</p>
