<h2>title: Scratchin' An Itch</h2>

<p>Reworking the <a href="http://www.ibl.org">website for my simulation baseball league</a> has brought forth my wanna-do-something side.  The website is looking good, and the next step is to get the theme that I want working properly and implement that stats-on-demand module that I've been promising.</p>

<p>However, I've also wanted to do something that I could share with other people.  In this case, I've decided to start an open source project.  My favourite programmer girl <a href="http://slash7.com">Amy Hoy</a> recently went through a site meltdown thanks to a scriptac.ulo.us cheatsheet getting <a href="http://digg.com">dugg</a>.  In that article she said that she wished she had a Rails-based weblog tracking application to use.  Some further discussions via IM with Amy convinced me that this is something I could do.</p>

<p>At my previous employer I did write a bunch of website-tracking code.  It was not very efficient in it's first incarnation but by the time I got around to getting the okay for a rewrite, they replaced it with something else that they paid a TON of money for.  Ah well.  Being older and wiser (and more experienced with such things) I know how I'd do this using Rails, so we'll see if I can put my money where my mouth is.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I've set up a small page for <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/r00bstat">r00bstat</a> just to get it out there.  I've already been working on the plugin part with some testing coming up in the near future (unit tests to be included!), but the accompanying Rails appication to display the data is the daunting part of the task.  I have a few ideas...and being able to develop on my laptop on the train is good way to try these things out.</p>

<p>Thanks to my friend <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> for helping me to come up with a suitable Web 2.0 name for the project. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" /></p>

<h2>title: Never Stop Learning</h2>

<p>I finally got around to using a gift certificate I'd gotten for my birthday back at the end of March and ordered myself a copy of <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/pad/index.html">Practices of an Agile Developer</a>.  Now, a lot of what is in there is common sense but my experiences have taught me that the forces of fate will toss common sense to the four winds if it can get it's talons embedded.</p>

<p>My eldest daughter (she likes the angel and devil sidebars in the book) asked me why I keep reading all these books.  I tell her it's because I never want to stop learning things, and reading these programming books also helps me to remember best practices for my job.</p>

<p>Until you do something a million times, you fall back on old habits.  But after a while the new habits <strong>become</strong> the old habits.  Yes, I'm an unfocused slacker at times but I do like to do things the right way (at least the right way as I see it).  Agile development practices seem to be the right way to me, but I sure didn't work in an agile development environment before.  Where I am now, I have a chance to put some of those ideas in play.  That makes me feel a lot better about sitting in a cubicle missing my old work buddies.</p>

<p>Pick up a copy of this book and check it out.  There is a lot of really neat information in there that even if you are only able to implement a few of the suggestions you'll be that much further ahead.  If you are going to cherry-pick a few suggestions I highly recommend getting both unit testing and automated integration testing put in place.  Ignore the old-timers and uberslackers who say that testing is lame and a waste of time.  Remind them of that the next time they are fixing a bug in their code that a series of tests would've revealed.</p>

<h2>title: Non-acid rephlux</h2>

<p>Since I apparantly have tons of free time, I'm helping out an open source project called <a href="http://rephlux.sourceforge.net">Rephlux</a>.  It's a continuous integration environment built for PHP.  Basically, you write SimpleTest unit tests and Rephlux checks out the code, runs the tests and creates reports for those tests.  Ideally, you run it on a seperate machine and it has RSS feeds that report on errors that it finds.</p>

<p>I'm a big believer in testing your code (always do tests for my new stuff) so this seemed like an interesting project to get involved in.  I've been talking with the creator and have already figured out a few tasks to contribute to the project.  Like <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/r00bstat">r00bstat</a>, I'll keep you posted.</p>
