<h2>title: Going To CakeFest!</h2>

<p>
Yes, it's been confirmed:  I will be attending <a href='http://www.cakefest.org'>CakeFest</a> down in Orlando Feb. 6 to 8.  I'll be giving a talk entitled "Fake It Until You Make It" about how to use the Cake console tools to speed up your development.  I use the Cake console for all my CakePHP projects, since it helps me quickly create the code for models, controllers (love being able to have all those admin methods already baked in) and I hope to show those who might be a little shy of using the command line what they are missing out on.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to be flying down Tuesday night, getting in around midnight and flying out Friday morning (it's looking like a 10:30 departure).  So that's two full days at the conference, which is okay.  Now, if anyone is going down there and could use a roomie to help cut down on costs let me know.

title: Simple User Registration in CakePHP 1.2, Part II
date: 2008-01-22</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>I got a question in the comments about my previous post on simple user registration about how to do some of the necessary validation for registration in the model.  I thought I'd show some code I did to do exactly that.
</p>

<p>
The key to all this stuff is using a second form field for doing the validation.  Here's some sample code for you, based on the latest straight-from-svn version of Cake PHP 1.2 (r6402)
<br /><br />
~~~
<?php

/**
 * Class used for user authentication on the league website
 *
 */

class User extends AppModel
{
    var $name = 'User';

    var $validate = array(
        'id' => array('rule' => 'blank',
                      'on' => 'create'),
        'username' => array('rule' => 'alphanumeric',
                            'required' => true,
                            'message' => 'Please enter a username'),
        'password' => array('rule' => array('confirmPassword', 'password'),
                            'message' => 'Passwords do not match'),
        'password_confirm' => array('rule' => 'alphanumeric',
                                    'required' => true)
    );

    function confirmPassword($data) {
        $valid = false;
        
        if ($data['password'] == Security::hash(Configure::read('Security.salt') . $this->data['User']['password_confirm'])) {
            $valid = true;
        } 
        
        return $valid;
    }

}
?>
~~~
</p>

<p>
So, let's talk about what's in there.  
<ul>
<li>make sure that the username is alphanumeric and has been entered</li>
<li>make sure the password exists and run the custom validation function 'confirmPassword' on the data being posted in</li>
<li>make sure that our confirm password field exists and is alphanumeric</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The only tricky thing when I made this was figuring out how to compare the two password fields, and where to get the proper hashing from.  Initially I thought that I could somehow import the Auth component in there but a quick chat with gwoo showed me how stupid that was when I could just duplicate how the component itself is hashing the password field.  That's what is going in with the use of Security::hash(...).
</p>

<p>
Hope that helps.
