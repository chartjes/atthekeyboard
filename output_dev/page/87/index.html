<h2>title: What's In Chris' Brain - May 2008 Edition</h2>

<p>Yes, it's the day after May Day (workers of the world, unite!) and yes, I only managed to get one blog post done this week.  So, it's time for a round-up of the stuff I've been thinking about this week.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>For all the bleating I did on the CakePHP mailing list this week about using free and open software, the editor waffling continues and I was back to Komodo today.  I needed the security blanket of an IDE today after spending way too much time with <a href="http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/">CSSEdit</a> trying to get stuff lining up properly for a work project.</li>
<li>Halfway through a code review project as a side gig.  Old code, running on PHP 4.4.8 (those of you following me on Twitter saw me moaning about getting that working with CentOS on Parallels).  Needless to say, the code is a mess but I have to actually talk about WHY it's a mess and what can be done.</li>
<li>Trying to see if I can get a caching plugin for WordPress to work with nginx.  Not that I ever expect to get Dugg, but you never know.  Almost there...</li>
<li>Finally managed to get a Django app running properly inside the Google App Engine SDK.  Work on that got torpedoed this week by two slow-pitch games...that got rained out...after me waiting around for 20 minutes or so.  Next step is to build out my web service for Rallyhat.  Should only be a few hours work (he said, not knowing now what he will know later)</li>
<li>YASP (Yet Another Side Project) is going to get rolling this weekend.  Some cool stuff using Amazon S3, integration with OpenID and PayPal.  This time I actually have a plan to make some money. :)</li>
<li>I've submitted my "Deployment Isn't A 4 Letter Word" talk for <a href="http://www.zendcon.com">ZendCon</a>.</li>
<li>Been updating the IBL web site to use the latest CakePHP goodies, meaning just refactoring a lot of stuff that was garbage and using newer techniques I discover via the mailing list and Nate Abele's rantings.</li>
<li>Special thanks to <a href="http://traviscline.com/blog/">Travis Cline</a> for sending me a copy of "xUnit Test Patterns" from my Amazon Wish list!  Many thanks to a fellow budding Djangonaut for the gift.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>title: CakeFest Hispania</h2>

<p>This was *supposed* to be a post about my successes in getting the Rallyhat web service up and running on Google App Engine, but that's not quite done yet.  Instead, I will inform our spanish-speaking CakePHP users (and the more adventurous types who enjoy travel) that the <a href="http://www.cakefest.org">CakeFest</a> site as been updated to announce <a href="http://cakefest.org/users/add">pre-registration</a> and other information about CakeFest #2, which will be held in Buenos Aries, Argentina at the beginning of December.
</p>

<p>
All your favourite people from the CakePHP world will be there, although I might not be able to make it despite Mariano's very convincing IM conversations.  The organizer (the previously-mentioned Mariano) is a great guy, good contributor to the project, and I still like him despite the fact that he is a Windows user in an ocean of Mac fanbois.  Maybe things will work out that I can go, but if you can make the trip it will be one of the most interesting conferences this year.

title: New CakePHP 1.2 Release Coming
date: 2008-05-13</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>I'm certainly not the only person who has been blogging about this, but I thought I'd mention that a feature freeze is coming up for the next CakePHP 1.2 release, codenamed 'DV'.  My very modest contribution this time around is a patch to fix a problem with running 'cake bake' on Windows, where it was mangling the app path that a user would enter.  <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/ticket/4495">Ticket 4495</a> if anyone is interested.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, anyone who uses CakePHP or wants to help out can definitely get involved in the process by:
<ul>
<li>Entering bugs into CakePHP's trac if they don't see them in there</li>
<li>Contributing tests and/or patches for existing bugs</li>
<li>Testing out the bleeding-edge versions of CakePHP that you can get from the SVN repository</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There has been a lot of debate on the mailing list about both the direction of the project and the attitude of people on the mailing list.  Well, as one of the people who gets to be involved in both sides (albeit a minor role in terms of contributing code) I can tell you that the project will continue moving forward, building on all the traction CakePHP has gotten.  Maybe 1.2 has dragged on for a while, but isn't that just a number anyway?  Would people be reacting if it was Cake 1.7.2 or something like that?
</p>

<p>What people don't always see is the amount of work that goes into CakePHP by developers.  Every morning when I log into my account on my MacBook, I update my copy of CakePHP from SVN.  99.999% of the time there is an update.  These days, tests are being written like crazy and <a href="http://debuggable.com/posts/code-coverage-analysis-soon-in-cakephp---test-how-well-you-test:4814f6a0-fe60-4f50-be0b-07194834cda3">Tim's awesome work in creating code coverage information</a> and those things can only help the project as a whole get better.  These are exciting times for anyone connected to the project, no doubt about that.  No amount of CakePHP haters (you know who you are) are going to change that.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, people have to understand that a mailing list full of a lot of technical, highly-skilled people is not a friendly place for beginners.  Sad, but true.  I have answered many questions on the mailing list, some of them properly and some of them, well, let's just say my nickname of GrumpyCanuck has been well-placed.  Can we all be civil?  Probably not.  Should we be civil?  Maybe.  I think anyone who doesn't understand the dynamics of the CakePHP list itself should go and read <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">this</a>.  Forewarned is forearmed.
