<h2>title: What's In Chris' Brain - Blog Experiment Version</h2>

<p>
I had a few drinks last night with my fellow <a href="http://www.hutchic.com">Milton-area PHP developer</a> and we got to talking about a lot of different topics.  I will summarize a few of them here:
</p>

<p>
<h3><em>Concurrency is still drawing significant interest from me</em></h3>
</p>

<p>I recommended my friend check out Tim Bray's <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/09/27/Concur-dot-next">Concur.next</a> series (yes, I know I'm whipping this topic like a dead hors).  We discussed how when you've done so much work in the stateless environment of the web, made slightly more state-full by hacks like sessions and Ajax, how hard it is to wrap your mind around the idea of concurrency and event-driven models of programming.  Much like Mr. Bray I believe that somewhere out there is what will become the popular toolkit for creating concurrent programs, both on the server and on web sites.</p>

<h3><em>What about data stores when coupled with concurrent code</em></h3>

<p>Say I were to create a stripped-down version of the XML-feed reading program that we sell at work.  Say I write it in, oh, Twisted Python and then have the documents it grabbed get tossed into the XML data store I'm using at work.  I imagine that I would grab my list of files to retrieve and then spin off a thread/agent/worker/whatever to grab each one, do the necessary processing and then insert that document into the database.</p>

<p>
So, I guess it comes down to the ability of the datastore itself to handle concurrent requests?  I mean, if I was talking to a RDBMS like MySQL or Postgresql, can I count on them to handle concurrent inserts or updates?  That is a question worth doing some research about.
</p>

<h3><em>There is an opportunity to become a domain expert in the NoSQL field</em></h3>

<p>
If you were a freelancer who wants to live on the cutting edge, I would seriously invest time in learning one of <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> / <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/">Cassandra</a> / <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home">MongoDB</a> and figure out scenarios where these can be used.  Next step?  Profit!!

<h2>title: Better Application Deployment</h2>

<p>I've been working on the <a href="http://www.sportsdb.org/sd/sportscaster">open source web service</a> that we make available to our clients, trying to get some caching into the application to improve performance.  It got me to thinking:  what would be the best way to get our clients to install this application.
</p>

<p>
By best way, I do not mean easiest way.  The easiest way is to say "here's the tarball, extract it and install it in place".  That's currently the method we use for distribution.  I must admit that I have been negligent in updating recent builds on the site.  The real solution here is to create an automated build system that I can use to package up newer versions of the code and put them up on the web site.
</p>

<p>
Others have suggested that I should examine the use of Pear as a way to distribute this PHP application.  That's fine, but the next time they update it would overwrite any changes they made to things like display templates.  So I guess the current method is the best...

<h2>title: So It Ends, Gentle Reader</h2>

<p>
Thanks so much for sticking with me during my November blogging experiment.  By my reckoning, I only missed one week-day blog post (it was on a Friday, and I posted something on a Saturday to make up for it.  I will not be keeping up with that pace in the month of December, but I do expect to cover some more interesting topics.
</p>

<p>
I have contemplated making December "blog reader month" where I do some blog posts on topics suggested by my readers.  Feel free to make requests in the comments, email them to me (if you can figure out my email address), or send 'em to me via Twitter.  I promise full attribution.
