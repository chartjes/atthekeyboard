<h2>title: CakePHP + Nginx Configuration Update</h2>

<p>In a previous post I had talked about how to configure CakePHP to work with <a href="http://nginx.net/">Nginx</a>, a lightweight, high-performance HTTP server.  I'm in the process of creating the website for my upcoming book *and* had recently switched back from using Apache to using Nginx again, so I thought it might be time to roll up my sleeves and figure out how to make it work in a subdirectory.  After much gnashing of teeth and pissing and moaning, I figured it out.
</p>

<p>
In this example, let's assume that we are going to be running our application out of /foo, and that we already have PHP applications running with Nginx already.  There are plenty of examples out there that you can google for.  So, what took me forever to do was to figure out how to properly make the second part of the rewrite rule.
</p>

<pre>
# configure Cake app to run in a sub-directory
# Cake install is not in root, but elsewhere and configured
# in APP/webroot/index.php
location /foo/ {
    index index.php;

    if (!-e $request_filename) {
        rewrite ^/foo/(.+)$ /foo/webroot/$1 last;
        break;
    }
}

location /foo/webroot/ {
    index index.php;

    if (!-e $request_filename) {
        rewrite ^/foo/webroot/(.+)$ /foo/webroot/index.php?url=$1 last;
        break;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
As stated before, I am not an Nginx expert so I will simply tell you what I *think* this configuration is doing.  First, it looks at any request that comes into /foo and if it can't find it right away, it then rewrites the request to go over to /foo/webroot.  Then, any requests that come in for /foo/webroot, it checks to see if it can serve the file directly, like if it was in the css or js directories.  If it can't, it then strips out everything *after* /foo/webroot in the request and passes it over to APP/webroot/index.php.</p>

<p>It was that second part that gave me the toughest time.  Once it finally dawned on me that I needed to remove '/foo/webroot' from the request, everything worked perfectly.
</p>

<p>
If there are any Nginx experts who can tweak this to work better, let me know.

<h2>title: CakePHP Plugins Server</h2>

<p>
I was asking around for a plugin / library / component / *something* that can help me to easily integrate the use of PayPal into the CakePHP application I'm building to be the web site for my upcoming book.  One of the movers and shakers in the CakePHP community, (you know, those people who actually contribute some code) John Anderson (aka psychic, the lead on the CakePHP Cookbook project) mentioned that he had a plugin I could use.  He also provided a link to an experimental <a href="http://plugins.thoughtglade.com/">CakePHP plugin server</a> he's setup and asked people to play around with.  That PayPal plugin was one of the ones being offered.
</p>

<p>
Basically, you download a CakePHP console application that John wrote which speaks to the plugin server, and then it allows you to install any of the plugins that are on the server.  Perhaps the first steps towards a number of plugin servers?

<h2>title: Book Update</h2>

<p>I'm about halfway through my book, with my own self-imposed deadline of Feb. 23rd rapidly approaching.  That's so I have a week to actually create the site to *sell* the book.  I posted on Twitter earlier today that I thought that using CakePHP to create the site to sell a book about CakePHP is overkill, but Nate Abele from the CakePHP project <a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele/status/1176654887">seems to think otherwise.</a>
</p>

<p>
So I thought I'd talk a bit about the actual process of writing this book.  First, I've been writing it in MacVim (The One True Editor(tm)) using <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> with the goal of converting the code to PDF with some CLI utilities.  So far I am very happy with how it is looking, but I have some concerns about the way <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf/">rst2pdf</a> implements syntax highlighting, so that is something I will have to look at before publishing.
</p>

<p>
For those wondering about how the book is going to look, I've stuck with a very simple process:
<ol>
<li>Show existing code</li>
<li>Show refactored code using CakePHP</li>
<li>Explain my decisions when things look non-intuitive.  In other words, explain the things I had to look up on Google before writing it. ;) </li>
</ol>
Expect copious code samples along with my own unique writing style.  Now, it's not too late for me to add things into the book so feel free to mention things you would like to see in the book in the comments section.  I cannot promise anything but I do read each comment.
</p>

<p>
One thing to keep in mind is that I've targeted the book at developers who already have some understanding of how to use CakePHP.  There are already two books out there that will get people up-and-running with CakePHP, plus the awesome <a href="http://book.cakephp.org">cookbook</a>.  What has been missing is actual examples of more intermediate-to-advanced use of CakePHP.  While I am not an expert in it's use (blame that on not using it at work) I have ported several old applications over to using CakePHP.  I'm hoping that I can help out people who actually need to use CakePHP and make some money for myself.  Not such a lofty goal, is it?
