<h2>title: "My framework is more MVC than <em>your</em> framework!"</h2>

<p>
I like to check out the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming">programming section on Reddit</a> on a regular basis because it usually contains some interesting links.  Yesterday I came across a link that discussed the fallout surround a presentation at phplondon08 where <a href="http://pookey.co.uk/blog/index.php?url=archives/43-phplondon08-the-crazy-guy-mail.html">panelists on a discussion of frameworks got heckled</a> but some guy claiming to be an expert on what a real MVC framework is.</p>

<blockquote>
All major Rails clone PHP frameworks that exist on the market today are a complete and utter failure. All of them call themselves MVC frameworks and none of them implement actual MVC. In fact, some of the worst ones merely resemble MVC, and have no right whatsoever to be called frameworks. Whatever benefits of sexy ORMs and flexible build systems and scaffolding and other secondary tools these frameworks have are nullified by the fact that using them results in architectural chaos which is no better than your usual spaghetti code. This is because the people who wrote Rails didn't bother to understand MVC, and the PHP amateurs who were excited about the idea of getting done more in less time blindly tried to clone Rails into PHP and in so doing not only replicated the stupidity of Rails into PHP but also multiplied it by their own incompetence and PHP's shortcomings as a language and a platform.
</blockquote>

<p>
No, tell us how you really feel about it.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, this guy apparently works for the <a href="http://agavi.org">Agavi</a> project, a (wait for it) MVC framework written in PHP as an "evangelist".  Well, he certainly talks like you would expect an evangelist too.
</p>

<p>
The comments for that post are really interesting too, as people take their usual swipes at PHP, and CakePHP, and the Symfony guys come out in droves to talk up Symfony, and on and on it goes.  Sadly, this is not a unique occurance on the web.
</p>

<p>
So, back to the topic of the post.  Is this guy right?  Is *nobody* except Agavi doing it right on the PHP side of things?  I took a peek at their documentation.  Lots of statements about what a framework should and shouldn't do.  
</p>

<p>
<em>(Author's note 03/10/08: removed code example as, well, it's not really relevant to the discussion, other than making me giggle about mixing business logic with presentation logic)</em>
</p>

<p>
Digging through the documentation some more, it's quite dry.  Short and sweet, not a lot of tips on building an Agavi app from scratch.  Again, to be fair, that might not be the point of the documentation.  But it's approach is very, *very* different from the "Rails way" that CakePHP has been following.  Before you flame, there is nothing wrong with the "Rails way" because, if nothing else, it has forced developers to crank their skills up a notch and actually *think* about what they are building.
</p>

<p>
I knew one of the original developers of <a href="http://www.mojavi.org">Mojavi</a> (of which Agavi is a fork) and he was a really smart guy (Hi Shawn!). My early forays into framework use was with Mojavi, when trying to convince a previous employer that we needed to rewrite this monster PHP application with Mojavi so we could get things like a private branding version of the site done a lot easier.
</p>

<p>When I compare this to Cake, they are as different as night and day.  Agavi (and Mojavi) are heavily configuration-oriented (XML *everywhere* for config files), while Cake uses conventions to try and speed things up.  But the real truth is this:  they are both trying to separate your business logic and your presentation logic to make things easier for the poor saps who have to build these applications.
</p>

<p>
Our lovely heckler has missed the forest for the trees, as far as I'm concerned.  It's like complaining that you can't call it a forest because the trees aren't growing straight up and down, but tend to branch out in different directions.  They're still trees, right?
</p>

<p>Frameworks are designed to try and help you to get things done faster *and* to organize your code in a much more consistent manner.  Cake uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">Model-view-controller design pattern</a>, and I think that the quote below makes it clear that Cake is doing it the right way:
<blockquote>
Model-view-controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern, which at the same time is also a Multitier architecture, used in software engineering. In complex computer applications that present a large amount of data to the user, a developer often wishes to separate data (model) and user interface (view) concerns, so that changes to the user interface will not affect data handling, and that the data can be reorganized without changing the user interface. The model-view-controller solves this problem by decoupling data access and business logic from data presentation and user interaction, by introducing an intermediate component: the controller.
</blockquote>
If you are trying to tell me that CakePHP does not follow that practice, then I am calling you a fucking idiot who is more interested in pedantic minutiae than understanding that there is more than one way to implement MVC.

<h2>title: Darn Spammers Got To Me!</h2>

<p>
My in-box is filling up with rejection emails from various places because some asshole spammer decided to use my domain name to send their spam.  Trust me, there's only three addresses that send out mail from littlehart.net and HolliscezanneMorse is not one of them.
</p>

<p>
My apologies to anyone who's gotten spam from someone claiming to be at the littlehart.net domain.  It isn't me.

<h2>title: What's The Next PHP Stack?</h2>

<p>Most developers who have worked with PHP for any significant period of time have heard of the LAMP application stack.  <b>L</b>inux, <b>A</b>pache, <b>M</b>ySQL and <b>P</b>HP.  This is probably the most common PHP application configuration out there, and I've been giving application stacks a lot of thought these days for a variety of reasons.  First of all, I'm giving a talk on application deployment at <a href="http://www.openwebvancouver.ca">Open Web Vancouver</a>, and the stack plays a big role in that.  Secondly, I'm always looking at new technologies and trying to figure out where they might fit in.</p>

<p>
Thirdly, there seems to be a trend towards providing "drop-in-place" PHP stacks for developers trying to figure out things locally.  I'm talking about things like <a href="http://www.mamp.info/">MAMP</a> and <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">Wampserver</a>.</p>

<p>
So the next thing I've been wondering about is about what future PHP stacks will look like, at least on the open source side of things.  Have we gotten to the point where this is as good as it gets?  I know for my own personal stuff, I've started moving away from the AMP part of LAMP, instead using Postgres for database stuff and nginx as my webserver.  So, what is that now?  LNPP?  That doesn't roll off the tongue as nicely as LAMP.
</p>

<p>
Also, are we limiting ourselves in the description of a stack by just going with PHP as part of LAMP?  With the rise of Javascript on the client-side and the increasing use of frameworks by developers (I'm *not* getting into that MVC argument again) do they need to be considered as part of the stack now?
</p>

<p>
So, my question to my readers is this:  what do you see as the future stack for PHP?  Is LAMP the combination likely to continue to see the most usage?  To spark things off, here are some of the PHP stacks I've been working with lately:
<ul>
<li>CakePHP + PHP + Apache2 + Postgres + Gentoo Linux</li>
<li>jQuery + Code Igniter + PHP + Apache2 + (<a href="http://exist.sourceforge.net/">eXist</a> + Postgres) + Debian Linux</li>
<li>jQuery + CakePHP + PHP + MySQL + nginx + Gentoo Linux</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Let me know your thoughts about the PHP application stack in the comments.  I mean, are we going to see something like an application server for PHP (like Mongrel for Ruby folks) or is mod_php or FastCGI (for the nginx + lighttpd folks) as good as it's gonna get?
