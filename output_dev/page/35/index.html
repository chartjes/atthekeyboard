<h2>title: What Chris Is Thinking About</h2>

<p>I'm just back from a long weekend (Thanksgiving in Canada) and very tired after a weekend where my youngest was sick, and clingy, and not sleeping well.  Such is life.  So, instead of a tutorial I'll have to talk about what I'm thinking about.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have to give a quick demo tomorrow of the code I posted the other day to post things to a vBulletin thread.  The problem?  A lack of baseball-related info coming down the pipe from SportsTicker.  I'll figure something out.</li>
<li>On the advice of my friend <a href="http://slash7.com">Amy</a> I'm going to investigate switching over the IBL site from using Typo to using Mephisto.  I'm having a hell of a time getting it installed though.  Not the best instructions available.</li>
<li>Trying to figure out what to build my super-secret project with:  Rails?  CakePHP?  Roll my own?  Toture myself by following <a href="http://yarivsblog.com">this guy's work</a> and build the site in Erlang.   Tough to decide.</li>
<li>Mourn the potential loss of my iBook to some weird hardware problem...it's in the hands of a MacGenius so we'll see what happens.</li>
<li>Take my iPod in for repairs...for a second time...with the same problems as before...and appearing after the latest iTunes update...and I'm not alone in seeing problems.</li></ul>

<h2>title: "Mini-book Review:  Ajax Design Patterns"</h2>

<p>
I've been visiting Michael Mahemoff's web site <a href="http://www.softwareas.com">Software As She's Developed</a> off-and-on for about a year.  He's an Ajax guru who does a cool podcast about his experiences with Ajax, and he even has a cool resouce called <a href="http://www.ajaxpatterns.org">Ajax Patterns</a> that has really helped me wrap my head around Ajax in general.  I took the plunge and bought his excellent book "Ajax Design Patterns" since I am trying to improve my Javascript and presentation skillz because I want to be part of the modern web.
</p>

<p>
Working with Javascript (once I got over prejudices picked up from reading other people's comments about Javascript) seems very natural.  If you know PHP, the syntax for Javascript is dead simple.  This book, when combined with the efforts of my only-met-her-once-but-talk-all-the-time-via-IM friend <a href="http://slash7.com">Amy Hoy</a> I feel like I'm starting to finally understand the impact using Javascript can have on a web site.
</p>

<p>
I'm only about 5 chapters in at this point but those 5 chapters have led me to believe that I made a solid choice in picking up this book.  Yes, this book focuses on "Ajax design patterns" but it really has a recipes-style feel to it.  As an aside, this book was on the shelf at my local bookstore near Chad Fowler's Rails Recipes book.  Yes, fate has a sense of humour.
</p>

<p>
So, Michael goes through all sorts of design patterns by presenting them as follows:
<ul>
<li>a story to illustrate what the problem is, usually in real-world terms</li>
<li>a technical breakdown of the problem</li>
<li>a neat section called "Forces" that explains concepts or items that you will encounter in applying the pattern</li>
<li>how the problem was solved using the design pattern</li>
<li>real-world examples if there are any</li>
<li>and the most important thing to a lazy programmer like me:  code examples</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When I first encountered design patterns, I didn't quite understand what they were or how they could help me.  These days, I have acquired the habit of figuring out the problem in words instead of code and then finding solutions to the words.  Design patterns are a shortcut to help you solve problems that, well, other people have already solved.  Hopefully you learn something in the process. :) </p>

<p>
This book is no different.  I found it so easy to jump around the book, reading up on a particular pattern ("Cross-Domain Proxy") to find what problem it's helping to solve ("How can you augment your application with services available elsewhere on the Web?) to what the short version of the solution is ("Create proxying and mediating web services to facilitate communication between the browser and external domains") and what other patterns are related to this one ("Since external calls can be expensive, the Performance Optimization patterns apply.").
</p>

<p>
I'm into reference books with examples on how to do things, so this book is obviously a natural for me.  Go check out Michael's <a href="http://www.softwareas.com">site</a> and if you are looking to really *understand*  Ajax then <a href="http://www.ajaxpatterns.org">Ajax Patterns</a> should be your first stop.

<h2>title: New Ads On The Site</h2>

<p>Yes, I've sold out and put some ads on my site.  But it's for a really good product that I won't hesitate to recommend.  I've enjoyed reading <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Default.aspx">The Daily WTF</a>, a blog dedicated to pointing out the absurdities developers encounter every day on the job.  When I found out they had created the HiddenNetwork I decided to jump on board to try and help out.
</p>

<p>
The ad you see on the right-hand side is from their network.  Prospective employers who read this blog who are looking to hire someone, please visit <a href="http://hiddennetwork.com/ref.ashx?1079">HiddenNetwork.com</a> to place an ad with their network.  It's hard to find talented people, and the folks at HiddenNetwork think that the type of people who read my blog are the type of people you want to hire.
</p>

<p>
I get money if people read this blog posting and post a job on the network using my referral code.  It's that simple.  Finding a good job is hard, so if I can help employers and employees find each other, I'm a happy camper.
