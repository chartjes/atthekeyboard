            <h2><a href="/blog/2012/06/18/why-dont-you-trust-your-developers">Why Don&#039;t You Trust Your Developers?</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>You went through the hard process of finding just the right people to work with
you on your awesome idea. You've picked some solid tools that your team
understands how to use and you are all excited to start cranking out the Next
Big Thing you've opted to work on.</p>

<p>So why don't you trust the developers you've hired to do the job without
supervision?</p>

<p>I've seen a trend where more and more people are claiming it is essential
for your team to be located in one spot: eating lunch together, creating things
together...and staying up until the wee hours of the morning fixing the
stupidly broken bullshit application you've released into the world together.</p>

<p>I've been coding for money since 1998. So that makes me a fucking internet 
senior citizen. Get off my lawn. I have spent roughly half that time either
working as the only developer for a company or as a remote developer on a team
I have encountered NOTHING in my career that
leads me to believe that having all your developers spending all their
time together in an office leads to any better results than a team of
distributed developers.</p>

<p>One of the alleged benefits of having your team all together in one place
is the "creativity and brainstorming" argument. You know, the one where
awesome things happen because you can turn to the person next to you and
say "you know, I just thought of something..." and BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE,
you have an awesome feature for your application.</p>

<p>For most of my career, the reality has been that developers sit there in
an open concept office with music being piped into their ears so that 
people won't distract them so they can get some fucking work done. Every
meeting, every random conversation, every interruption as their boss
decides today's the day we start working on his favourite feature is a
barrier to getting work done.</p>

<p>So why don't you trust the developers you've hired to do the job without supervision?</p>

<p>Is it the "Puritan work ethic" that accompanied early immigrants to North
America that causes this? People have decided you are not allowed to have
fun while working? Being remote means I can create an environment for
myself that allows me to be the most productive. This means music playing
without headphones...and a system that notifies me when my co-workers
need to communicate with me. It means a nice comfy lounger with cushions
that I can sit in in order to think about a tough task...with my laptop
in my, um, lap while doing so. It means that my comfort while working is more
important than your desire to have me sitting where you can keep an eye
on me.</p>

<p>Could I ever create that environment in a cubicle? Not a chance, Open offices AND cubicles 
serve as a reminder that someone is always watching, you cannot be free
to choose your work environment, and you better stop fucking around and get
that work done. To me it all says "we don't trust you."</p>

<p>So why don't you trust developers you've hired to do the job without supervision?</p>

<p>Again, I understand that people working in startups feel that the chaos
is a necessary part of the process. I happen to disagree with that sort
of philosophy because I feel even an application with minimal features should
be executed on with 100% effort. If you think you will "do it right next time"
then I don't know if I want to be around next time you try.</p>

<p>A control freak
who gives you a nice office, chair, free snacks and a playroom with
video games is still a control freak. They believe that you need to be
near them at all times during business hours in order to be trusted to
do the job they've asked you to do. All those things are an incentive
to get you in the office for however long THEY feel you need to be there.
How else can you explain it, if you are being rational and honest about it?</p>

<p>So why don't you trust your developers you've hired to do the job without
supervision?</p>

<p>I'd love to hash this out more in the comments, so let me know what you think.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2012/06/06/dic-vs-service-locator">DIC vs. Service Locator</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>People often ask me what's the one thing they could do for their code base
RIGHT NOW that will make it easier to test. To me, the answer is simple:
make sure you are using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency Injection</a>
(yes the link is long and has code samples in Java, but whatever). Without
the ability to "inject" your dependencies into your code (whether it is 
class methods or functions) you will have problems testing modules of
code in isolation from each other.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://grumpy-testing.com">book on buiding testable PHP apps</a> I touched upon Dependency Injection
and I also mention the concept of a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Dependency Injection Container</a>
(sometimes also called Inversion of Control Containers). On the surface it
sounds like a really useful tool: you put all your dependencies inside the
container and then inject those dependencies into your classes and functions.</p>

<p>The use of DIC's has become a common pattern in PHP frameworks, as it does
offer you an easier way to access those dependencies. But I encourage people
to be careful with how they choose to use these containers, because they can
add unanticipated dependencies to your application.</p>

<p>If you use dependency injection without the container, then you have code that
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
namespace Grumpy;

class Foo
{
    protected $_bar;
    protected $_baz;

    public function __construct(\Grumpy\Bar $bar, \Grumpy\Baz $baz) {
        $this-&gt;_bar = $bar;
        $this-&gt;_baz = $baz;
    }
}

// In our test, using PHPUnit's built-in mock support
$mockBar = $this-&gt;getMock('\Grumpy\Bar');
$mockBaz = $this-&gt;getMock('\Grumpy\Baz');

$testFoo = new \Grumpy\Foo($mockBar, $mockBaz);

</code></pre>

<p>Very straightforward to see the dependencies that we are trying to inject
into the class, and you can see exactly what dependencies you will have to
create mock objects for in your tests.</p>

<p>If you use a container as a container ONLY then your test setup changes 
a bit.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

/**
 * Code for Foo is the sanme but how we get the dependencies is different
 * because we are going to place them in the container first and then
 * explicitly inject them
 */
$container = Context::getDependendencyContainer();
$container['bar'] = $this-&gt;getMock('\Grumpy\Bar');
$container['baz'] = $this-&gt;getMock('\Grumpy\Baz');

$testFoo = new \Grumpy\Foo($container['bar'], $container['baz']);

</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of the DIC is to have all your dependencies in one place
where they are easier to grab. It's a great concept, but it can easily
morph into a new dependency with one architectural change.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
namespace Grumpy;

class Foo
{
    protected $_bar;
    protected $_baz;

    public function __construct(\Grumpy\Container $container) {
        $this-&gt;_bar = $container['bar'];
        $this-&gt;_baz = $container['baz'];
    }
}

// In our test, using PHPUnit's built-in mock support
$mockBar = $this-&gt;getMock('\Grumpy\Bar');
$mockBaz = $this-&gt;getMock('\Grumpy\Baz');
$mockContainer = $this-&gt;getMock('\Grumpy\Container');
$mockContainer['bar'] = $mockBar;
$mockContainer['baz'] = $mockBaz;

$testFoo = new \Grumpy\Foo($mockContainer);

</code></pre>

<p>So what is so potentially bad about this? Well, now you've introduced a
dependency into your code such that it relies on the dependency container
instead.</p>

<p>I've worked with code bases that make heavy use of containers to do more
things than just store dependencies to be injected into your code. If 
you've every used Zend&#95;Registry to store things that you then retrieve
later you will know what I am talking about.</p>

<p>So what is really the difference between a service locator and a 
dependency injection container? I think the difference is in how you
use them. If you are using a container and manually injecting dependencies
into your code, then you are using what I guess you could call a 
"pure" dependency injection container. Once you start injecting
the container itself into your objects, it's no longer just a container.
It's a service locator since you will use it to retrieve all sorts of
things your application might need.</p>

<p>I understand why people use the container that way. It's easy! It's
convenient. It's a pain in the ass to test, is what it is.</p>

<p>In the end, it's really an architectural choice that you need to make.
Personally, I prefer to combine the two: use the container to store
you dependencies but "manually" inject them into your classes and
functions. I prefer this technique because it makes it easier up front
to determine the dependencies the code you are testing are going
to need.</p>

<p>Remember kids, the
goal is to create code that is easily understood and easily testable, 
or else <a href="http://twitpic.com/9p5o2x/full">this guy</a> might come looking
for you to "ask you some questions about your code".</p>

        <div>
            <p>So how does the Grumpy Programmer write code, TDD style? It starts with 
using a set of tools that reduce the amount of friction required.</p>

<p>First, I do almost all my work from a terminal. On my Macbook I use
<a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm 2</a> instead of the stock
Terminal.app. Until recently you could not get 256 colours without
some external hacking and since I like my editor to have purty colours
I needed a terminal to match it. I might take a look at Terminal.app
again, but iTerm 2 fits the bill.</p>

<p>Why the terminal? PHPUnit is a CLI application. Yes, many popular
editors and IDE's can do things like execute PHPUnit for you, but they
are limited in what flexibility they provide. At Kaplan we have several
different configurations under which we can run our tests. Again, reduce
the friction between the tools and you using them.</p>

<p>Then we have the <a href="http://www.vim.org">One True Editor</a>. While I do use
other editors from time to time (I do like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> 
a lot because it has Vim bindings), I stick with Vim. Why? The plugins.</p>

<p>Here's what I use:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> to make loading other plugins easy</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=102">DiffDir</a> for making code review and test reviews easier </li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2423">Gist.vim</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=13">closetag</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AndrewRadev/inline_edit.vim">inline_edit.vim</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">nerdtree</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ervandew/supertab">supertab</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/surround.vim">surround.vim</a> - it has ruined me for using other editors</li>
<li><a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/aligning-text-with-tabular-vim/">Tabular.vim</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar">tagbar</a> - INDISPENSABLE</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat">vim-repeat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thisivan/vim-taglist">vim-taglist</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired">vim-unimpaired</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is nothing specific to doing TDD in these plugins, but what they
do for me is allow me to slice and dice text as quickly as possible, along
with providing me with easy ways to navigate through the code base. Remember,
reducing friction is a big thing to me. If the tool makes it tough for me
to do what I want, it will be the target of grumpy ranting.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I like Sublime Text 2 is that you can jump all over the
place in the code base in similar ways. If you editor doesn't allow you to
do that, you need to get rid of that editor and use something that does.
NO EXCUSES.</p>

<p>A typical coding session has me using two terminal windows. One has Vim running
in it, the other is used to run PHPUnit or other testing framework of choice as
I venture in the world of BDD and testing in other languages. Then I do the 
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>figure out HOW to test the code I'm writing</li>
<li>write the tests required</li>
<li>write code until the tests pass</li>
<li>refactor code as required </li>
<li>refactor tests as required.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's really all their is to it. The actual work flow of when you are using
TDD isn't magical. I will admit that experience is the only teacher for how
to actually write the tests, but luckily I have an awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/FreshWillisms">co-worker</a>
who bellows obscenities at me while guiding me down the path to total testing
mastery. I know Will, you only hate me because you love me.</p>

<p>Every time I make a change to a test or the code, I re-run the tests. I find that
this lets me get more done while actually slowing down the pace. You end up
more focussed on the bit of code that really needs your attention, instead of
getting drawn into blind alleys.</p>

<p>I also frequently run code-coverage reports to make sure that I'm getting
maximum coverage for my efforts, while ignoring writing tests specifically
for methods with very low CRAP indexes. Again, I'm making sure that I am
targeting the parts of my code that need to be tested.</p>

<p>I know I've written about this before, but when you approach things from a
TDD perspective, you find that using things like dependency injection
become second nature.</p>

<p>If there is a lesson to be learned from this, it's to make sure that every
tool that you use reduces the friction that is generated when building
your application using TDD.</p>
