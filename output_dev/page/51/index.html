<h2>title: "Lazyweb Job Posting:  Webmaster with PHP Skills"</h2>

<p>Do you live near Irvine, CA?  Are you really good at HTML/CSS/Javascript and know some PHP as well?  My employer <a href="http://www.syneron.com">Syneron</a> is looking to hire a webmaster to maintain the corporate web site and probably work on some other projects.  If you're interested, send your resume to me at my work address (chartjes at the company domain.  Figuring this out is a good intelligence test :))

<h2>title: Zend_Service_Audioscrobbler moves to Zend Framework Core</h2>

<p>It finally made it!  After some major reworking of the unit tests (at 86% coverage, with 3 more tests to come after the freeze is up) and <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> busting his butt to get the documentation done, Darby Fenton emailed me to tell me that he's moved our component for connecting to the web services being offered by <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net">Audioscrobbler</a> (and that powers <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> out of the incubator and into the core.</p>

<p>
Although I lobbied very hard at work to use <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> as the framework for web applications, I'm going to be using <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a>.  After a week of using it, well, it's actually not too bad.  Daniel Kushner (my boss) is showing me all sorts of neat stuff I can do with ZF, and we're already extending the framework by adding plugins and custom components.  I suspect it won't be long until I'm an old hand and using this framework.
</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm quite happy that my component has made it into core, and I've already started thinking about my next component.  It's going to be a work-related one, so I have to talk to Daniel about whether or not I can officially work on it as a Syneron employee or will it be something on my own time.  More to come later.</p>

<h2>title: What's In Chris' Brain, March 2007 Edition</h2>

<p>Not a whole lot going on.  I joined the <a href="http://www.blackberry.net">crackberry</a> cult today, as my work got me a Blackberry.  It's a very nice little tool, and I look forward to customizing it a little more.  I've already added in a GMail tool so I can check GMail if I'm away from the computer for an extended period.  Anyways, onto what's in Chris' brain.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rallyhat.com">Rallyhat</a> is sitting there doing nothing.  No time.  *sigh*.  Maybe I'll move my baseball blog over to it.  Want to do *something* with that domain.</li>
<li>My <a href="http://www.teachersatrisk.com">mother</a> wants me to do a random posts sidebar widget for her blog (she uses <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>) as a birthday present.  Is she totally wired in or what?</li>
<li>Interactive console for CakePHP is moving forwards, albeit at a very slow pace.  Added in a token parsing loop, but not totally tested.  I'm really resisting simply cut-and-pasting the shell example I took from <a href="http://www.phpontrax.com/">PHP on Trax</a>, preferring to actually *gasp* understand how their interactive shell works.  It's about 400 lines of code I'm looking at, and hoping to chop it down.</li>
<li>I have a hard deadline of April 1 to get the new <a href="http://www.ibl.org">IBL</a> site up and running.  I'm about a week behind.  So, that is at the top of the queue, followed by the widget for my mom and then pounding out that shell.  I really would like to have that shell done for my talk in May, as a cool tool that has been "ported" from the Rails world over to PHP</li>
