<h2>title: Going To Christmas Town</h2>

<p>I'm off with the family to visit <a href="http://www.bronners.com/">the world's largest Christmas store</a> and do some cross-border shopping.  See you all on Monday.  I'm sure my mind will be churning about code generation and concurrency all weekend long, much to the dismay of my wife</p>

<p>
I do admire how she has learned to indulge my ramblings about programming when she is not a programmer at all and doesn't really care. ;)

<h2>title: Rambling on the future of PHP</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://terrychay.org">Terry Chay</a>, although he disagrees with me on a whole bunch of different levels, is a smart guy.  Despite all the profanity.  And the troll baiting.  Go watch <a href="http://sfphp.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/chinese-proverbs-video-nov-5th-2009/">this talk he gave at the SF PHP meetup</a>.
</p>

<p>
I struggle with some of the concepts he talks about here.  I've been working with PHP for so long and wondering "is that all there is to web programming?".  PHP is still one of the best solutions out there for building web applications.  The haters can suck it, because it's true.  Terry has this awesome quote (I'm probably paraphrasing).:  "The straightest point between two lines on the web is PHP.".  There are lots of huge sites out there that use PHP - but PHP *itself* is starting to become the bottleneck.
</p>

<p>
I won't comment any further as Terry says it better than I could, and to say more would be stealing from his talk.  Go and watch.

<h2>title: What's In Chris' Brain Today</h2>

<p>She Who Must Be Obeyed asked me what I wanted for Christmas, so I'm going to ask for a copy of "Code Generation In Action" along with some other programming books.  Make your suggestions in the comments if you please (and feel free to buy me a copy of that Code Generation book just like the awesome <a href="http://twitter.com/wlkh">Walker Hamilton</a> did when he bought me a copy of Martin Fowler's Refactoring book.  It's on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2ZNT96VNHBEQ2">Amazon Wish List</a></p>

<p>She asked me to get her a cat because she thinks our remaining cat is lonely and misses his roommate of 8 years.  I agree.</p>

<p>Speaking of refactoring, I used the following refactoring patterns today:  Remove Assignments to Parameters, Add Parameter and Inline Temp.  I'm sure I did others but those are the ones I can remember</p>

<p><a href="http://addons.mozilla.org">The Mozilla Add-ons Site</a> has decided to <a href="http://micropipes.com/blog/2009/11/17/amo-development-changes-in-2010/">migrate from CakePHP to Django</a>.  AMO was one of THE largest CakePHP sites out there, and I believe they have been quite fair in their reasoning as to why CakePHP no longer fits their own needs.</p>
