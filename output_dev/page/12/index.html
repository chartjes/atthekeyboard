<h2>title: Graphing Results</h2>

<p>As I've been pecking away at my article for php|architect (up to 1700 words now) I realized I need to add a section about user tracking for your application.  Here at work I've been introduced to a powerfull tool called <a href="http://www.cacti.net">Cacti</a>, which uses something called <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a> in order to generate nice graphs of, well, just about anything.</p>

<p>In my case I've been learning how to use it in order to do some user tracking not only for our <a href="http://www.tunerfriends.com">TunerFriends</a> site, but for a <a href="http://www.autoforums.com">new site that is launching tomorrow</a>.</p>

<p>If there is one complaint I have of Cacti is that, well, the user-supplied documentation sucks.  For real answers you have to go to their forums.  I got a lot of help, more than you would think a n00b would get from  your typical open source crowd.  It's pretty good though...lets us graph all sorts of things.  Basically, I can write PHP scripts that hit our databases, grabbing a bunch of numbers and then tell Cacti to create graphs based on that output.  Pretty simple stuff and it saves me the toruble of writing my own (which I despise, having done it many times).</p>

<p>Yes.  I admit it.  I like PHP.</p>

<p>I've been working exclusively in PHP for so long writing PHP code has become second nature to me.  When I use other languages I ask myself how I would do this in PHP, then look for the equivalent in whatever language I'm using, whether it be Perl or Ruby or whatever.</p>

<p>Now, as Ruby-On-Rails has picked up speed, my old, comfortable friend PHP has been getting beaten up all over the place.  It's too simple!  It's messy!  It has no structure!  It lacks consistency!</p>

<p>Now, I like Rails too...but Rails isn't perfect either.  I'm still waiting to hear of a Rails-based application that takes the type of traffic that some PHP-based applications do...like <a href="http://www.sexsearch.com">my former employers</a>.  Harry Fueks has posted an <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/02/21/a-pro-php-rant/">excellent rant in support of PHP</a> on his blog.</p>

<p>Go read it and tell me that PHP isn't the right tool for creating large web sites.</p>

<p>Which reminds me...I've finished the rough draft of my article for <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a> magazine.  Just under 4100 words, and I have a few diagrams and code examples to put in.  I'm pretty happy with it but I'm sure the editors will have a few things they will want me to fix.  No problem.  If there's one thing I've learned, it's how to handle people critiquing my work and suggesting changes.  Can't be a developer without that skill, believe me.</p>

<p>Almost after I wrote my last entry I remembered a site that takes huge amounts of traffic that was built with Rails.</p>
