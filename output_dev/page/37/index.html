<h2>title: What Chris Is Thinking About, November Edition</h2>

<p>Hi guys, two days of looking after my daughter at home has fried my brain and reduced my creative output. So, here's what I've been thinking about.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the new Amazon web services stuff is *perfect* for my supersecret project, so it's time to stack talking about it and get 'er done (horrible Larry the Cable Guy reference)</li>
<li>If <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com">this PHP 5 web framework</a> is good enough for Yahoo! (the world's largest user of PHP) to use to build their Yahoo! Bookmarks application, it's time for me to look at it and see if it will work with the supersecret project.  <a href=http://cakephp.org>CakePHP</a> is good...but Symfony's extensive documentation just blows it out of the water for the experienced-with-php-but-not-with-the-framework crowd.  I went through the Ajax tutorial that they had and after figuring out how to configure Apache to serve up my app and how to turn on debugging mode I did the whole tutorial in about 20 minutes (that's with my daughter sitting in my lap).</li>
<li>Also, time to stop procrastinating and get going on the Rails version of my administration portal for <a href="http://www.ibl.org">the IBL</a>.  I always need side projects to learn new technologies, so this is the perfect Rails-plus-Ajax vehicle.</li>
<li>Oh yeah, also gotta time up the loose ends on my <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net">Audioscrobbler</a> component for <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a>.  I've got 80% of the unit tests done, so I need to finish those up and write the documentation on how to actually use the sucker.</li>
<li>Way too many outstanding projects...gotta get some closure on this stuff I've been working on.  It's no good to have 5 projects in various stages of completeness.  Have to turn them into 5 projects that are done.
</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>title: PHP Community Card Deck</h2>

<p>
A while back Cal Evans (editor of <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">Zend Developer Zone</a>) sent me an email asking me to send him a picture of myself for a community project that he thought would be fun.  Being a huge egomaniac, I sent him probably the best picture of myself my wife has ever taken with our digital camera.  The result?  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/calevans/sets/72157594355906012/">PHP Community Playing Cards</a> deck.  I'll be getting a copy of the deck in the mail from Cal.  I'm the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/calevans/286001179/in/set-72157594355906012/">8 of Diamonds</a> in the deck.
</p>

<p>
I'll be sure to play Go Fish with my oldest daughter when I get my copy.

<h2>title: The Constant Battle That Goes On In My Head</h2>

<p>
As I start working on my <a href=http://www.rallyhat.com>super secret project</a> (in true Web 3.14159 style you can't tell anything about it from the domain name) I have to make a decision on what technology to use.  In my case, it's a battle between <a href=http://www.php.net>PHP</a> and <a href=http://www.rubyonrails.com>Ruby on Rails</a>.
</p>

<p>
So what do I do here?  My PHP skills are more advanced than my Rails skills, but I feel like I could easily pick up what I need to know in Rails because, well, programming knowledge of web-based languages is really transferable.  But this project is supposed to be fun at the same time.  I could build it in PHP, but that's not really much of a challenge.  So I'm going to build it in Rails because I'll learn something new by building this application.  In the end, it's all about learning for me.  I've built a simple blog with Rails before, so it will be interesting for me to see if Rails lives up to the "productivity boost" that I (and others) have been claiming.
</p>

<p>
I also think I need to go and buy the revised version of the Agile Software Development for Rails book.  Never hurts to have some dead-tree information about Rails.
</p>

<p>
So what is the site about?  Can't tell you quite yet.  I'll be finding some hosting and putting up a splash page shortly.  I happen to think that it will be a very interesting application, and one that will generate a lot of fun for the people who choose to use it.
