<h2>title: \"Lies I Told My Kids\" -- Python + Flask + GAE</h2>

<p>As many of my readers know, I've been slowly expanding my Python skills over the last 18 months or so.  First, I fooled around with Django on my laptop, really liking what I saw. Next, I started using it to write scripts for pre-calculating fantasy point totals at my <a href="http://xmlteam.com">old job</a>. Finally, I had been looking at Google App Engine and seeing what it would take to put a very simple Python site up there. I had a few options.
</p>

<p>
I could use the web application framework Google provided in Python called <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/usingwebapp.html">webapp</a>, but I decided I wanted to learn a framework I could use outside of GAE as well. I really like Django but, until recently, there were a whole bunch of hoops you had to jump through in order to get it to play nicely with GAE. It's easier now, but I started this project a while ago and it's been bitrotting on my laptop. Also, I was frustrated with Django because the application I was trying to build with it just wasn't a good fit and <a href="https://mapalong.com/hello">someone beat me to it</a>. Not Django's fault, and I would gladly use it again to build something else.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I decided I wanted to use a very lightweight framework because I felt that my lack of Python expertise meant a lot of the magic going on in Django (like any awesome full-stack framework) was difficult for me to understand as a PHP guy who was trying not to write Python code like a PHP guy. So, after hashing things out via IM with my friend <a href="http://chiggsy.com/">Kevin</a> I chose <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, which bills itself as a "microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.".
</p>

<p>
I found Flask very easy to use, and the documentation helpful to a beginner like me. I could easily start to see where a more advanced developer could create things just the way he wanted. Once I found <a href="https://github.com/kamalgill/flask-appengine-template">an awesome template for running Flask on GAE</a> I was off and running.
</p>

<p>
The application itself was very straight-forward: collect user submissions about the little white lies parents tell their kids, and show them in a paginated fashion. The twists? I was going to store them in the GAE datastore (so I had to learn their API) and I also wanted to use <a href="https://github.com/defensio/defensio-python">Defensio</a> to pre-filter submissions and identify ones that might be spammers trying to get stuff in there. Pro-tip for you developers out there: if the library you want to use has tests, that is the first place you should go to see how to actually use the library.
</p>

<p>
So, in bits and pieces over a few months (basically whenever inspiration struck and there was nothing I wanted to watch on TV with the wife) I put the application together.  It's functioning the way I want it to (although I admit I didn't do a ton of testing of the pagination, so maybe I'll hack at that later) but needs some help on the UI side. Feel free to <a href="http://liesitoldmykids.appspot.com">check it out</a> and add your submission.

            <h2><a href="/blog/8800/11/25/grumpy-programmers-guide-to-remote-working-part-2">The Grumpy Programmer&#039;s Guide To Remote Working, Part 2</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As mentioned in the previous post about remote working, you do have to work a lot harder when you're not in the same office as your co-workers in order to simply get things done. If you took my advice you've got yourself a sweet setup at home, with a comfy chair and a nice desk. But that is only the first battle in the on-going war that is successful telecommuting. In this post I want to talk about some tools that I use that I feel help me Get Shit Done when working from home.</p>

<p>First, since you don't have the instant feedback loop of a fellow cubicle dweller or even office-sharing partner, you need tools that can act as a second set of eyes for you before you open what is often an expensive communication channel to your co-workers. Not expensive in terms of money (unless you have to call people long distance and don't either use VOIP at home or Skype) but expensive in terms of time. Making that initial "communication handshake" is expensive in time and commitment.</p>

<p>So for me, the first set of eyes I use are <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> or Chrome's web developer tools, depending on which browser I'm using. Those let me peek at the HTML being generated and debug any Ajax calls your application is making. It used to be my primary tool until <a href="http://twitter.com/ramsey">my boss</a> asked me why I wasn't using <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a>, an awesome debugging proxy application for OS-X, Windows and Linux.</p>

<p>Charles acts like what it says: it's a web debugging proxy. It sits between your browser and your next work connection, monitoring and showing you what connections you are making. Why is this awesome you might ask? I can record an entire series of clicks on a web page and play them back later for testing purposes.
I like Charles for a few reasons. This is helpful because one of our main applications at Moontoast is a flash-based store and Charles will show me the request that the flash SWF is making <em>and</em> I can see the response that is coming back. I am not a flash developer, but I do need to make sure that code I write that is supposed to talk back to the SWF (via AMF) is returning correct values. I like to record Ajax calls and repeat them over and over until I am happy with the response coming back. Please, please, PLEASE check out Charles. It is worth every penny.</p>

<p>So now that I have someone else helping me debug my Ajax and AMF calls, what other tools do I find useful. Well, if you don't have your editor already tricked out to reduce the amount of work you have to do <em>outside</em> of your editor to get things done then I advise you to actually learn your editor inside and out. As a vim user I spend a lot of time evaluating plugins that can help me out. I use <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">Syntastic</a> to run my code through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_programming_tool">code linter</a> every time I save it. I use <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Fugitive</a> to work on my Git commits and merges. All in all, it's important that you be as productive as possible using the tool you write your code with day in and day out.</p>

<p>Of course, it goes without saying that you should be probably be writing your own tests for your code that you can automate. Don't worry, this is not going to turn into another sales job for automated testing. PHPUnit, PHPSpec, Selenium, please use something that acts as an automated tester for you. I mean, it seems to work for me so maybe it can work for you.</p>

<p>So that's really it in terms of tools that I have found that I used more and more as I telecommuted more and more. My criteria for evaluating any tools is this: is it easy to use, can it automate something I don't want to do manually, and does it easily integrate into my existing workflow. Firebug and Charles fit that criteria. Plugins for my editor fit that criteria. CLI test runners fit that criteria.</p>

<p>In other words, any tool that can make you more productive in an office setting is even more important when working remotely with a team. Anything that you can do to reduce the testing and integration step benefits you and your team, and helps to convince management that their decision to allow you to continue to work remotely is a good one.</p>

<p>I'm interested in hearing other people's experiences telecommuting and tools that they have found to be helpful. Comment in this post, send me some email (chartjes AT this domain) or hit me up on Twitter.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <h2>Challenge 0: have a computer around as a kid</h2>

<p>I've been programming computers since I was 10 years old. That's 31 years and counting. I had my first paid programming
job at age 15, when I created a program for my mother's private school to display a salary grid based on numbers they
entered via the program itself, written in Apple basic. Sadly, there was no testing framework available to me.</p>

<p>When I went to community college, it was before the Rise Of The Internet. I had net access and an email account,
but there was no graphical web browser I had access to. I remember seeing something called "Mosaic" on the desktops
in the computer labs, but I did not have access to it. So I surfed, hard core style, using Lynx. Yes, I am that
old.</p>

<h2>Challenge 1: get an IT job</h2>

<p>Once I was done with school, I landed a job working for a company that produced fully-licensed CD compilations for
professional DJ's. I was their "IT guy" but ended up building my first web app: an online searchable catalog
that used MySQL. I wrote code that imported a CSV export from Microsoft Access and then built a form to let
people search for stuff. It sort of worked. I didn't know about wild card searches or <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-functions.html#function_soundex">Soundex</a>
but I was pretty proud of myself.</p>

<ul>
<li>learned PHP</li>
<li>learned some MySQL</li>
<li>discovered I still liked programming</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenge 2: get a programming-only job</h2>

<p>When that job ended, I found a job with a company that was using <a href="http://metahtml.sourceforge.net/">some programming language</a>
I had never seen before, and haven't seen since. I also got to use PHP to build an online shopping store for a 
specialty retailer.</p>

<p>Everything went well...until it didn't, and people who weren't stock holders (it was a publically-traded company)
got the boot.</p>

<ul>
<li>learned more PHP</li>
<li>learned to work as part of small team</li>
<li>failed the political office game</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenge 3: Get a job on a bigger team</h2>

<p>After that job, I got to sit on my couch with my infant daughter and watch 9/11 happen in real time on my TV. A few
months later I got a job working for a company that dealt with online adult content and wanted to build a dating
site. The company still is around, and it's not hard to google around to figure out who it is. It is a different
place now, but when I worked there I committed the first line of code for the project into a CVS repository.</p>

<p>It was a great education in what it takes to build a scalable PHP application, but my attitude was terrible while
I worked there. I was argumentative, belligerent, and basically acted like everything that was done that I disagreed
with was the worst decision ever. I learned what it was like to work on a large team, and I learned again that
getting along with your co-workers mattered when it was time to do things you really wanted to do.</p>

<p>I lost the political game, and lost it hard. My own damn fault, to be sure.</p>

<ul>
<li>learned even more PHP</li>
<li>used my first MVC-style framework (Mojavi!)</li>
<li>first exposed to unit testing</li>
<li>first exposed to virtual envrionments for dev work (BSD jails!)</li>
<li>learned that I needed to pay attention to the political game </li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenge 4: Go someplace you feel you're wanted</h2>

<p>After leaving that job, I took a job working for a company that owned a network of online forums for sports and
auto enthusiasts, along with publishing several auto magazines. Terrible fit, never got to do anything except
play with CakePHP and start really blogging more. My blogging while working there led to me getting my next
job...and every job since.</p>

<ul>
<li>learned how to do technical blogging</li>
<li>learned how to contribute to an open source project (CakePHP)</li>
<li>learned epic trolling skills on a mailing list</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenge 5: Work from home</h2>

<p>After leaving the forum job, I bounced through two jobs (left one cuz funding was pulled, left the other due
to severe personality conflict with boss) and landed my first serious telecommuting gig working for a 
sports data integration company. I was sick of the long commute (90 minutes in the morning, two hours home)
and held out for a job where I could work from home.</p>

<p>Loved the job. Lots of freedom to build things the way I saw fit, with a few
constraints of language and associated tools (had to be ones we where using already). I also started ramping
up the blogging, and grew my reputation through speaking at conferences and trying to find people I could 
always learn things from.</p>

<p>I also learned that when you build things for customers, you really should try to talk to those customers
as much as you can to understand how to build what they want.</p>

<ul>
<li>learned some Python</li>
<li>learned how to work remotely without someone needing to check up on you</li>
<li>learned how to explain technical things to non-techincal people given a proper context</li>
<li>learned how to self-promote on Twitter and build your "brand"</li>
<li>learned how to get accepted at conferences</li>
<li>learned how to get mad about getting rejected to speak at conferences</li>
<li>developed ridonkulous levels of confidence in both my own skills and my abilities to find jobs I want to do</li>
<li>started co-organizing a PHP user's group in Toronto</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenge 6: Find a job doing what you want to do</h2>

<p>Potential NFL and NBA strikes had me nervous about my awesome-to-work-for employer going under, so I jumped
ship and joined a start-up that was focussing on ecommerce within social media tools and networks. I liked
the guys I worked with, but felt out of place: the things I was passionate about (best practices and testing)
weren't a good fit for the place they were in (OMG WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS THING AND GET IT LAUNCHED) so after
a personally-frustrating year I left to join a place doing the types of things I wanted to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>learned how to wrap tests around reluctant code bases</li>
<li>learned how to write an ebook</li>
<li>learned how to do a podcast about programming issues</li>
<li>started organzing a PHP conference in Toronto</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenge 7: Keep finding challenges</h2>

<p>Which of course leads me to the present. I'm now doing the type of coding work I want to do: focusing on 
testing practices, researching tools to improve our developer work flow, and also branching out in the outside
world to helping more developers be aware of just how valuable adding good testing practices to your skill
set could be.</p>

<p>You can see all the challenges I put in front of myself, and how things didn't always end up the way I had hoped.
If I can overcome all this stuff, imagine what you can get done! There will never be a better time to get
involved in building stuff for the web. You are spoiled for choice on tools, languages and opportunities.</p>

<p>Don't be scared. Be excited. It only gets crazier from here on out!</p>
