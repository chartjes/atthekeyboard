<h2>title: Zend Certificate <em>Finally</em> Arrives</h2>

<p>Went and picked up my framed certificate from Zend that they mailed to me from the post office today.  Nice to finally have it...I'll put it up on the wall of my basement office once it gets built in the summer.</p>

<p>However, what bugs me is how long it took to get here.  The postage on it says it was mailed on November 21st.  From California.  That's almost 3 weeks to get here.  That's ridiculous.</p>
