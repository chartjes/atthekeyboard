<h2>title: Live From php|works (Keynote edition)</h2>

<p>
I'm sitting in the conference room at php|works listening to the Father of PHP Rasmus Lerdorf give his always-interesting talk on creating rich web apps.  But he lead things off with a talk about how the web is broken, and how IE has been the tool used to break it.

<p>
I've become a believer in how important web security is, so I'm glad to see senior figures in the PHP community talking about how important security is.  Now that my project for rallyhat.com is in the planning stages, I've been thinking a lot about security because I will be accepting a lot of user input.

More updates to follow as the conference goes on.
