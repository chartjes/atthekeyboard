<h2>title: Please Do Not Adjust Your Set</h2>

<p>You know how sometimes you use a piece of software and you just don't like the internals of it?  Then you switch to something else that is cleaner, and looks bettter?  And then it just unexpectedly stops working?  That's why I'm back on WordPress.  The missing post I did will be back up later today.
