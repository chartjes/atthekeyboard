<h2>title: Komodo and CakePHP</h2>

<p>
For those who remember how I was an <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2008/03/18/im-an-editor-waffler/">editor waffler</a> will remember that I play around with <a href="http://community.activestate.com/products/Komodo">Komodo</a> from time to time, and decided to get back into using it again.  There are alpha 5.0 versions available so I downloaded one and tried it out.  Seems to be less resource hungry than previous versions (as in it doesn't cause my fan in  my MacBook to start up every time I open Komodo).  Now, since I know a few people at Activestate I emailed Jeff Griffiths to ask him a few questions.  He responded by hacking together something very quickly for <a href="http://community.activestate.com/node/2794">adding code intelligence for CakePHP to your views</a>.  If you're a Komodo user (or are interested in trying out Komodo), try it out and let Jeff know how it's working out.
