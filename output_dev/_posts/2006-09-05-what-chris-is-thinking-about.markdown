<h2>title: What Chris Is Thinking About</h2>

<p>Another lively round-up of things I'm thinking about</p>

<ul>
<li>ugh, this consulting gig I'm doing is cutting into my prep-time for doing slides for my presentation on the 14th</li>
<li>making more plans for my supersecret project</li>
<li>what happened to the unit tests I wrote for my Zend Framework AudioScrobbler plugin?  Gotta dig through the subversion logs</li>
<li>Comet (streaming requests from server to browser and back for things like web-based chat like Meebo) looks very interesting...and may have some applications for my supersecret project</li>
<li>SportsTicker just blasts too much info at you in their streams.  I could work full-time just parsing all the data out</li>
<li>Ruthless refactoring always shows you that what you thought you knew when you started on a piece of code is always vastly different from what you actually knew when you finished it</li>
</ul>
