<h2>title: What's In Chris' Brain Today</h2>

<p>She Who Must Be Obeyed asked me what I wanted for Christmas, so I'm going to ask for a copy of "Code Generation In Action" along with some other programming books.  Make your suggestions in the comments if you please (and feel free to buy me a copy of that Code Generation book just like the awesome <a href="http://twitter.com/wlkh">Walker Hamilton</a> did when he bought me a copy of Martin Fowler's Refactoring book.  It's on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2ZNT96VNHBEQ2">Amazon Wish List</a></p>

<p>She asked me to get her a cat because she thinks our remaining cat is lonely and misses his roommate of 8 years.  I agree.</p>

<p>Speaking of refactoring, I used the following refactoring patterns today:  Remove Assignments to Parameters, Add Parameter and Inline Temp.  I'm sure I did others but those are the ones I can remember</p>

<p><a href="http://addons.mozilla.org">The Mozilla Add-ons Site</a> has decided to <a href="http://micropipes.com/blog/2009/11/17/amo-development-changes-in-2010/">migrate from CakePHP to Django</a>.  AMO was one of THE largest CakePHP sites out there, and I believe they have been quite fair in their reasoning as to why CakePHP no longer fits their own needs.</p>
