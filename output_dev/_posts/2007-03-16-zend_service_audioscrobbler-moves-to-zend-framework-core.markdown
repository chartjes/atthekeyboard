<h2>title: Zend_Service_Audioscrobbler moves to Zend Framework Core</h2>

<p>It finally made it!  After some major reworking of the unit tests (at 86% coverage, with 3 more tests to come after the freeze is up) and <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> busting his butt to get the documentation done, Darby Fenton emailed me to tell me that he's moved our component for connecting to the web services being offered by <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net">Audioscrobbler</a> (and that powers <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> out of the incubator and into the core.</p>

<p>
Although I lobbied very hard at work to use <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> as the framework for web applications, I'm going to be using <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a>.  After a week of using it, well, it's actually not too bad.  Daniel Kushner (my boss) is showing me all sorts of neat stuff I can do with ZF, and we're already extending the framework by adding plugins and custom components.  I suspect it won't be long until I'm an old hand and using this framework.
</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm quite happy that my component has made it into core, and I've already started thinking about my next component.  It's going to be a work-related one, so I have to talk to Daniel about whether or not I can officially work on it as a Syneron employee or will it be something on my own time.  More to come later.</p>
