title: PHP Frameworks...are they worth the trouble?</p>

<h2>author: Chris Hartjes</h2>

<p>My open source project has gotten underway, as the three conspirators met and hashed out how we wanted the view/template part of the system to work.  We got to play around with <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> and it's great collaborative capabilities.  It was cool to see me edit something in the document, then the <a href="http://www.derekmartin.ca">other guy</a>, and then <a href="http://www.jobblender.com">our other partner</a> add in his info.  You should seriously check it out sometime.</p>

<p>But I've started to wonder if <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> hasn't, well, spoiled me.  When I think about how to implement Rails in PHP (although <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">Cake</a> is trying), I realize that I don't know if it could be done as slickly as Rails was done with Ruby.  Doing a half-assed web application framework is easy.  Doing a good one is hard.</p>

<p>And on top of this all, Zend annoucned their new <a href="http://www.zend.com/collaboration/">PHP Collaboration Project</a> which, at this time, consists of working with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> to make it easier to do PHP dev work with it (Zend Studio 6 maybe?), and...a PHP framework.  Open sourced.  Blessed for use in the "enterprise".</p>

<p>So, maybe the second part of the Grand Project must wait until we take a look at what Zend comes up.  I can't help but wonder if <a href="http://http://www.xisc.com/">this little project that won a Zend programming contest</a> is what will become the Zend PHP Framework...</p>
