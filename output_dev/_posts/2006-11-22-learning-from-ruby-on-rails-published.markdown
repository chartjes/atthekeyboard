<p>My latest magazine article for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect magazine</a> entitled "Learning from Ruby on Rails" was published today.  You can think of it as a companion to my talk I gave at php|works back in September.  One thing I will have to do is see how much of the article was edited.  I worried that I rambled and that it would deviate too much from my talk.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I encourage you to read it and send me your feedback.</p>
