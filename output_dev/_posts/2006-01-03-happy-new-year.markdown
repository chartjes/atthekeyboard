<h2>title: Happy New Year!</h2>

<p>I hope everyone out there had a fun holiday season.  I enjoyed all the time I spent with my kids (and fought against the inevitable accusations of favouritism leveled against me by the 6 year-old with respect to the 10 month-old).  In the meantime, I decided on my programming-related goals for 2006:</p>

<p>1) get the new <a href="http://www.ibl.org">IBL site</a> up and running before the season starts
2) learn how to use the new Zend Framework when it appears
3) clean-up the scripts I use to generate data for the IBL card set, possibly re-writing them in Ruby
4) keep up the standard of writing easy-to-maintain, secure-when-I-can-do-it code in all my projects</p>

<p>4 pretty lofty, yet achievable goals.  Feel free to share your goals with me...</p>
