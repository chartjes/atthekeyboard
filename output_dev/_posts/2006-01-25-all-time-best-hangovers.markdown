<p>I went out for beers with my former work buddies at our <a href="http://www.martiniboys.com/pages/reviews/rhino.htm">usual hangout</a> and a good time was had by all.  This morning I was talking with <a href="http://www.juliansimpson.com">Julian</a> about all-time best hangovers.  Here are my top 3:</p>

<ol>
<li>23rd birthday where I tried to drink 23 rum-and-cokes (it was 1.08 drink night) and made it to 19</li>
<li>My bachelor party (although all the drinking got done in a ridiculously short period of time)</li>
<li>A company Halloween party where it was packed with webmasters and staff, and it was OPEN BAR.  My friend Kris still talks about that party to this day.</li>
</ol>
