<h2>title: "What's In Chris' Brain: September 2008 Edition"</h2>

<p>
It's time again for a round-up of the ideas that have been bouncing around in my head this past month, because I don't have enough material for a big blog post.  Not yet, any way.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh look, <a href="http://manning.com/obrien/">another CakePHP book</a> coming out that I can review if the author pulls some strings.  Yes, I'm talking to YOU AD7Six</li>
<li>Although the title of the presentation is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Fr65PFqfk">"Why I Hate Django"</a>, Cal Henderson from Flickr shows why you simply cannot avoid frameworks when building applications.  Deny this fact at your own peril.</li>
<li>If you're not already reading their blog, check out Felix and Tim (and sometimes Nate) over at the <a href="http://debuggable.com/">Debuggable Ltd.</a> blog where you can find some of the best CakePHP tips around.  Felix is closing on on 30 straight days of blogging, though not always CakePHP related.</li>
<li>I'm going to be in Mountain View, CA next Wednesday (the 24th) for a super-secret meeting and have some time to kill before my red-eye flight back home.  Maybe we can hook up so you can hurl abuse at me and so I can get enough alcohol in me to sleep on the red-eye flight back to Toronto?</li>
</ul>
