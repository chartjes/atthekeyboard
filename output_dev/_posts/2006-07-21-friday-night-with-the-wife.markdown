<h2>title: Friday Night With The Wife</h2>

<p>I'm sitting here watching the Blue Jays game with my wife and a commerical for "Ant Bully" (a new animated movie this is, oddly enough, about ants) comes on.</p>

<p>My wife: "Haven't there been enough ant movies lately?"
Me: "Why are you such a hater?"</p>

<p>Ah, wedded bliss.</p>
