<h2>title: "Ask My Readers: Development Environments"</h2>

<p>I thought I'd turn things around a pick and ask my readers for some advice on particular topics.  Today's topic is Development Environments.</p>

<p>
Currently, I run Zend Server Community edition on my laptop to match what we're using in production (except on the new production games platform server, where I am running Nginx + Apache and not using ZSCE) but have been rethinking this for no reason other then "try and make it better."  One thing I have thought of doing is to use virtual machines on my MacBook to accomplish this.  I have Virtualbox, and I use it to test things once in a blue moon on IE7 and IE8.  Given that it takes up a lot of space I have been thinking to either use it or get rid of it.

<p>
Do any of my readers have experience with doing development work using localized virtual servers?  Keep in mind that I am using <a href="http://www.vim.org">The One True Editor</a> so I would have to be able to edit code in the virtual machine from my laptop (best case) or on the virtual machine (worst case).
