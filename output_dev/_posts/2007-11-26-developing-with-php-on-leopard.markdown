<h2>title: Developing with PHP on Leopard</h2>

<p>I recently bought a new MacBook (took the huge street-cred hit by getting a 13" white MacBook) and are busy getting my development environment up and running.  I had heard some rumblings that things weren't quite what they seemed when it came to getting PHP up and running in Leopard, and spent much time googling for things.</p>

<p>
My main dev environment is Apache2+PHP+MySQL/Postgres, so I searched around and found that Sean Coates (from <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a> and a guy I've had several beers with at conferences) put together some great instructions up on <a href="http://blog.phpdoc.info/archives/83-php-5.2.5-on-Leopard.html">on getting PHP 5.2.5 up and running on Leopard</a>.</p>

<p>
If you are upgrading to Leopard, those instructions are the best I've seen so far AND do nothing to mess up your existing Leopard Apache and PHP installation.</p>
