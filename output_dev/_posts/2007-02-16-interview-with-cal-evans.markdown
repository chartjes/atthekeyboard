<h2>title: Interview with Cal Evans</h2>

<p>Back in September when I was at php|works I did an <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/1701">interview</a> with Cal Evans, the editor of Zend's Dev Zone.  We chatted for about 30 minutes about various topics (we have similar introductions to the world of computers) but he had to cut it off there.  We had even more interesting discussions during the course of the conference, but a lot of those will have to stay buried for the time being...
