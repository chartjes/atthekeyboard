            <p>I really like browsing through <a href="https://usesthis.com">Uses This</a> to see what
folks from all sorts of industries use to get the job done. Since they are
unlikely to invite me, here's my own details. I share in hopes of discovering
new tools for doing my job and showing folks who haven't been doing this for
20 years what "professional programmers" use. You might be surprised.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-you%2C-and-what-do-you-do%3F">Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>

<p>Monday to Thursday am I working for <a href="https://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> as part of
the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> Test Engineering group
where I test web services that Firefox talks to, along with deployment testing
of some internal developer tools and a <a href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto">generic JSON document store</a>
that we built ourselves.</p>

<p>On Fridays I continue to work on <a href="https://grumpy-learning.com">Grumpy Learning</a> stuff.
I'm currently writing a "how to test legacy PHP code" video training course for
a large online education provider and are organizing a personal-development course
called <a href="https://grumpy-learning.com/grumpy-conf.php">GrumpyConf</a> that will be held
March 22-24, 2018. No new books on the horizon and I currently only appearing at
<a href="https://tek18.phparch.com">phptek 2018</a> in late May of this year.</p>

<p>If you want me to come speak at your event in the fall, get in touch.</p>

<h3 id="what-hardware-do-you-use%3F">What hardware do you use?</h3>

<p>My main device is a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">13-inch 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar</a> with 
16 GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD drive. It runs in closed-mode 99.999% of the time
plugged into a <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-27-ultra-hd-4k-monitor-p2715q/apd/210-adof/monitors-monitor-accessories">Dell P2715Q display</a> and I use the Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english">Magic Keyboard</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2">Magic Mouse 2</a>. When I travel I bring a <a href="https://www.therooststand.com/">Roost laptop stand</a> with me. Being a Large Human
using the Roost has made it so I can actually work in environments other than
my configured-for-me home office.</p>

<p>I also make heavy use of an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone6s">iPhone 6S Plus</a>
mostly for messaging and <a href="https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer">Twitter</a> use.
I also have a Samsung Chromebook that I can do some PHP web development work on but
it is not powerful enough for the day job. I tried it out to see if it was
suitable as a road laptop for a world where border crossings can quickly
turn ugly. Right now it's not.</p>

<p>I listen to a lot of music (yay <a href="https://spotify.com">Spotify</a>) and since I
did notice the poor quality of audio from my laptop I splurged and bought
a <a href="http://www.audioquest.com/dragonfly-series/">DragonFll USB DAC</a> along with
the <a href="http://www.audioquest.com/jitterbug/jitterbug">Jitterbug USB data and power noise filter</a>.
I now have awesome, clean-sounding music coming from my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KVEIY4E/?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAALxg">desktop speakers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="and-what-software%3F">And what software?</h3>

<p>I use macOS (always using the latest stable version of it -- patch your systems people!)
as my development environment and some flavour of Linux (usually <a href="https://ubumtu.com">Ubuntu</a>)
as a deployment environment.</p>

<p>When I am doing <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> (which is what I use at Mozilla) I am using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>
and if I am doing <a href="https://php.org">PHP</a> I am using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>.
For everything else I am using <a href="https://neovim.io">Neovim</a>. I used to be a Vim-only person
but over the years I have found the value that IDE's provide me to be invaluable.
They have totally-acceptable-to-me Vim bindings anyway.</p>

<p>I make heavy use of the CLI and use <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>.</p>

<p>For work I rely on the following tools every single day:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://irccloud.com">IRCCloud</a> for talking to co-workers</li>
<li>Mozilla uses Google Mail and Google Calendar, which works nicely with my phone</li>
<li><a href="https://vidyo.com">Vidyo</a> for video conference -- great product, works well</li>
<li>Firefox web browser. I run the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/">Nightly</a> version</li>
</ul>

<p>When I do <a href="https://devhell.info">my podcast</a> with Ed, I use <a href="https://skype.com">Skype</a> with
the <a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/">Call Recorder</a> plug in. I send the recording
of my side to him and he fixes it all up.</p>

<p>On my iPhone I use the following apps quite a bit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mail.app</li>
<li>Mobile Safari</li>
<li><a href="https://twitterrific.com/ios/">Twitterrific</a> (and on macOS too)</li>
<li><a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> for listening to podcasts</li>
</ul>

<p>I also use all sorts of other apps (messaging ones mostly) like any long-time
user of an iOS device.</p>

<p>I am a competitive-casual <a href="https://magic.wizards.com">Magic: The Gathering</a>
player, mostly playing the Legacy format (but with a splash of Vintage
and the random cube or EDH game mixed in). For many years I was frustrated
with my lack of success at the tournament level. I was lucky enough to
fall in with a group of people who made me realize that I actually enjoyed
the social aspect of the game the most.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup%3F">What would be your dream setup?</h3>

<p>I've worked from home for 11 years now -- I never want to go back to a
full-time office experience ever again. I'm totally happy with my
computer and my display and all the other tools I use. I tend to upgrade
things incrementally instead of in big shots. I like consistency and
the ability to quickly get back to work when upgrading any of my
equipment.</p>

<p>I hope this helps! Got any more questions or suggestions of things I should
check out. Hit me up on Twitter or via the email link in the sidebar.</p>
