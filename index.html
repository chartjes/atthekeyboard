            <h2 id="tl%3Bdr---adding-support-to-an-existing-symfony-3.4-application-for-doctrine">TL;DR - Adding support to an existing Symfony 3.4 application for Doctrine</h2>

<p>(If you like the work I do on OpenCFP, please consider sponsoring me at
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/chartjes/">https://github.com/sponsors/chartjes/</a>)</p>

<p>Part of the medium-term planning for <a href="https://github.com/opencfp/opencfp">OpenCFP</a> is
to refactor the application to stop using <a href="https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentinel/">Sentinel</a>
as the authentication and ACL choice and start using the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html">Symfony Scurity</a>
component.</p>

<p>When OpenCFP was first built it was a more standalone solution and I picked Sentinel's
predecessor, Sentry. As it got deprecated, we moved to Sentinel and along the way we
added in some code to make <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/eloquent">Eloquent</a> easier to
use within the app. When switching to be more Symfony-based, Doctrine is the ORM that
needs to be used. So I have a refactoring process that looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get Doctrine and it's dependencies into the project</li>
<li>Refactor everything <em>except</em> our auth stuff to use Doctrine</li>
<li>Refactor our authentication and authorization code to use Symfony Security</li>
<li>Remove Sentinel and all it's dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>I had not used Doctrine in many many years so a lot of things have changed. Given
all the trouble I had, I figured I was not alone so it makes sense to document
the changes and additions I made.</p>

<p>As with most work I do on OpenCFP, this was a journey of discovering things I needed to
know that I did not know.</p>

<h2 id="packages">Packages</h2>

<p>Following the directions for <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/doctrine.html">Symfony 3.4</a> I
installed my dependencies:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">composer require doctrine/orm
composer require doctrine/doctrine-bundle
composer require doctrine/doctrine-cache-bundle
</code></pre>

<p>Right now, <code>composer show</code> says I have the following Doctrine-related packages installed now</p>

<pre><code class="bash">doctrine/annotations                v1.8.0  
doctrine/cache                      1.9.1   
doctrine/collections                1.6.4   
doctrine/common                     v2.11.0 
doctrine/data-fixtures              1.4.0   
doctrine/dbal                       v2.10.0 
doctrine/doctrine-bundle            1.12.2  
doctrine/doctrine-cache-bundle      1.4.0   
doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle   3.3.0   
doctrine/event-manager              1.1.0

doctrine/reflection                 v1.0.0  
symfony/doctrine-bridge             v3.4.35 
</code></pre>

<p>I may have installed some of these packages manually, but who knows.</p>

<h2 id="enable-doctrine-in-the-application">Enable Doctrine in the application</h2>

<p>The first sign I had no idea what I was doing was when I could not see
any of the Doctrine-related commands when I used <code>bin/console</code>. After
moaning on Twitter and asking some questions on Stack Overflow, I realized
it would not automatically find it. so I added a line to my <code>Kernel.php</code>
file so that the bundle would be available.</p>

<pre><code class="php">    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            new FrameworkBundle(),
            new SensioFrameworkExtraBundle(),
            new MonologBundle(),
            new TwigBundle(),
            new SwiftmailerBundle(),
            new WouterJEloquentBundle(),
            new OneupFlysystemBundle(),
            new DoctrineBundle(),
        ];

        if ($this-&gt;getEnvironment() !== Environment::TYPE_PRODUCTION) {
            $bundles[] = new DebugBundle();
        }

        if ($this-&gt;getEnvironment() === Environment::TYPE_DEVELOPMENT) {
            $bundles[] = new WebServerBundle();
            $bundles[] = new WebProfilerBundle();
        }

        return $bundles;
    }
</code></pre>

<h2 id="making-repositories-available-as-a-service">Making repositories available as a service</h2>

<p>I had to update my `resources/config/services/services.yml' file with the following
new section to allow the app to find and inject all the repository files I was going
to create:</p>

<pre><code class="yaml"> OpenCFP\Domain\Repository\:
    public: true
    resource: '%kernel.project_dir%/src/Domain/Repository/*'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="configuration-files">Configuration Files</h2>

<p>To make Doctrine see the database connections, I had to modify the
following files:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">resources/config/config_development.yml
resources/config/config_testing.yml
resources/config/config_production.yml
</code></pre>

<p>adding in the following details (determined through trial-and-error and online searches for help)</p>

<pre><code class="yaml">doctrine:
  dbal:
    url: mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:3306/cfp
    default_table_options:
      charset: utm8mb4
      collate: utg8mb4_unicode_ci
  orm:
    auto_mapping: true
    auto_generate_proxy_classes: true
    mappings:
      OpenCFP\Domain\Entity:
        type: annotation
        dir: "%kernel.root_dir%/../src/Domain/Entity"
        prefix: OpenCFP\Domain\Entity
</code></pre>

<p>Early on I had my integration test suite failing to even run because it was complaining it
could not find the new repository I had created:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace OpenCFP\Domain\Repository;

use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository;
use OpenCFP\Domain\Entity\Airport;

final class AirportRepository
{
    /**
     * @var EntityRepository
     */
    private $repository;

    public function __construct(EntityManagerInterface $entityManager)
    {
        $this-&gt;repository = $entityManager-&gt;getRepository(Airport::class);
    }

    public function withCode(string $code): ?Airport
    {
        $airport = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;findOneByCode($code);

            return $airport;
        }

        return null;
    }

namespace OpenCFP\Domain\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="airports")
 */
final class Airport
{
    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type="string", length=3)
     * @ORM\Id
     */
    private $code;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type="string", length=255)

    private $name;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type="string", length=255)
     */
    private $country;

    /**
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function getCode()
    {
        return $this-&gt;code;
    }

    /**
     * @return mixed

    public function getName()
    {
        return $this-&gt;name;
    }

    /**
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function getCountry()
    {
        return $this-&gt;country;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The issue turned out to be I needed to set <code>auto_generate_proxy_classes</code> to be <code>true</code>. The
error messages from the application itself were not helpful (complaining it could not inject
the <code>EntityManagerInterface</code> my code was using). Anyway, once I figured that out my integration
test suite passed. Now I could go and modify my code to use the new repository instead of the
Eloquent model.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of the steps I took to update the action that uses airport details</p>

<ul>
<li>removed references to the <code>AirportInformationDatabase</code> object that was used to access the list of airports and codes</li>
<li>added in the use of the new <code>AirportRepository</code> object</li>
<li>updated the constructor for the action to accept <code>AirportRepository</code> as a parameter via the magic of autowiring dependencies</li>
<li>updated the code to use the new repository (and fix a code smell involving an exception being caught but never reacted to)</li>
</ul>

<p>So now my tests pass and I have a way to add more Doctrine entities and repositories going forward.</p>

           <h3>May 15th, 2019</h3>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>For the first half of 2019 I was borrowed by the Performance Team
at Mozilla and asked to help them implement a way to measure the
performance of various browsers on Android platforms. This has
involved me getting familiar with several tools and environments
that I had not touched before:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mozilla's tooling for use with <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a></li>
<li>Rooting Android devices for testing purposes</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">Android Studio</a> and it's device emulation tools</li>
<li>Executing and parsing shell commands</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, I am using <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> as well to make sure
that I had thought about testing scenarios and giving whomever
supports this code once I am back at my previous role a chance
to figure out what is going on.</p>

<p>One of the testing scenarios I came up with was handing the fact that I
had designed the code to have a fallback mode in case the
shell command I was using did not work on that particular
device. Some code reviews from other developers revealed
some differences in how the <a href="https://www.unixtutorial.org/commands/top"><code>top</code> command</a>
works on different phones.</p>

<p>So, drawing  on my own experiences with using test
doubles in PHP, I asked myself "how can I create
a mock that has different return values?". In
pytest this functionality is called <code>side_effect</code>.</p>

<p>So, here is some of the code in question that I needed
to test:</p>

<pre><code class="python">try:
    cpuinfo = raptor.device.shell_output("top -O %CPU -n 1").split("\n")
    raptor.device._verbose = verbose
    for line in cpuinfo:
    data = line.split()
            if data[-1] == app_name:
                cpu_usage = data[3]
except Exception:
    cpuinfo = raptor.device.shell_output("dumpsys cpuinfo | grep %s" % app_name).split("\n")
    for line in cpuinfo:
        data = line.split()
        cpu_usage = data[0].strip('%')
</code></pre>

<p>I wrapped the first call in a try-catch construct because
an exception is thrown if anything is up with that <code>top</code>
call. If that call doesn't work, I then want to use that
<code>dumpsys</code> call.</p>

<p>In the test itself, I would need the <code>shell_output</code> call
to first throw an exception (as expected for the scenario)
and then return some output that I can then parse and use.</p>

<p>In the PHP world, most test doubling tools allow you to
create a mock and have it return different values on
consecutive calls. Pytest is no different, but it took
me a while to figure out the correct search terms to find
the functionality I wanted.</p>

<p>So, here is how I did it:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def test_usage_with_fallback():
    with mock.patch('mozdevice.adb.ADBDevice') as device:
        with mock.patch('raptor.raptor.RaptorControlServer') as control_server:
            '''
            First we have to return an error for 'top'
            Then we return what we would get for 'dumpsys'
            '''
            device.shell_output.side_effect = [
                OSError('top failed, move on'),
                ' 34% 14781/org.mozilla.geckoview_example: 26% user + 7.5% kernel'
            ]
            device._verbose = True

            # Create a control server
            control_server.cpu_test = True
            control_server.test_name = 'cpuunittest'
            control_server.device = device
            control_server.app_name = 'org.mozilla.geckoview_example'
            raptor = Raptor('geckoview', 'org.mozilla.geckoview_example', cpu_test=True)
            raptor.device = device
            raptor.config['cpu_test'] = True
            raptor.control_server = control_server

            # Verify the response contains our expected CPU % of 34
            cpuinfo_data = {
                u'type': u'cpu',
                u'test': u'usage_with_fallback',
                u'unit': u'%',
                u'values': {
                    u'browser_cpu_usage': '34'
                }
            }
            cpu.generate_android_cpu_profile(
                raptor,
                "usage_with_fallback")
            control_server.submit_supporting_data.assert_called_once_with(cpuinfo_data)
</code></pre>

<p>Let me break down what I did (as always, I am open to
suggestions on better ways to write this test).</p>

<p>The first double is for a class that communicates with the
Android device. Then the next double I needed was for the
"control server", which is what is used to control the
browser and execute tests.</p>

<p>My first "side effect" is to generate an error so it
triggers the first condition of the scenario that
'top should not work'. The second "side effect" is
the response I am expecting to get from the shell
command in my fallback area of the code.</p>

<p>Then I continue with the "arrange" part of the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert">Arrange-Act-Assert</a>
testing pattern I like to use -- I configure my
"control server" to be the way I want it.</p>

<p>I finish up with creating what I expect the data
that is to be submitted to our internal systems
looks like.</p>

<p>I execute the code I am testing (the "act" part)
and then use a <a href="https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/spy">spy</a>
to make sure the control server would have submitted
the data I was expecting to have been generated.</p>

<p>The ability to have a method return different values
is powerful in the context of writing tests for code
that has conditional behaviour. I hope you find this
example useful!</p>

<p>Let me break down what I did (as always, I am open to
suggestions on better ways to write this test).</p>

<p>The first double is for a class that communicates with the
Android device. Then the next double I needed was for the
"control server", which is what is used to control the
browser and execute tests.</p>

<p>My first "side effect" is to generate an error so it
triggers the first condition of the scenario that
'top should not work'. The second "side effect" is
the response I am expecting to get from the shell
command in my fallback area of the code.</p>

<p>Then I continue with the "arrange" part of the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert">Arrange-Act-Assert</a>
testing pattern I like to use -- I configure my
"control server" to be the way I want it.</p>

<p>I finish up with creating what I expect the data
that is to be submitted to our internal systems
looks like.</p>

<p>I execute the code I am testing (the "act" part)
and then use a <a href="https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/spy">spy</a>
to make sure the control server would have submitted
the data I was expecting to have been generated.</p>

<p>The ability to have a method return different values
is powerful in the context of writing tests for code
that has conditional behaviour. I hope you find this
example useful!</p>
