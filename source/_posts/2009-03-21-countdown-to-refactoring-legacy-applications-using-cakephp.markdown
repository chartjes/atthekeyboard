title: Countdown to "Refactoring Legacy Applications Using CakePHP"

<p>
April 1st is the date when my book will FINALLY be available.  $10 for the PDF, $20 for a print-on-demand copy via Lulu.  Go to the <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/book">website for the book</a> for more information and how to be notified when the book is ready.

I'm excited to see this project finally see the light of day and I hope it helps other people learn what a great tool CakePHP really is to get real-world work done.
