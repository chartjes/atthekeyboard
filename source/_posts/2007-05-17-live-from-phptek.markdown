title: Live from php|tek!
---
<p>Just finished giving my talk at php|tek 2007, and feedback was good.  Still talked a little too fast, but I think I can conquer that problem.  Anyhow, I totally forgot to record the talk as a screencast (the speaker before me talked all the way through my prep time) so all I can give you is the slides.  If any of the attendees read my blog (c'mon, I know you do!) I'd appreciate some feedback.  I was planning on retiring this talk...but I think it still has some legs for future conferences.</p><a href='http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/phptek-2007.pdf' title='Slides from php|tek 2007'>Slides from php|tek 2007</a>
