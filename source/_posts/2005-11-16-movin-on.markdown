Today has been a bittersweet day.  I handed in my resignation at my current employer and are moving on to work at <a href="//www.verticalscope.com"">VerticalScope</a>.  I've been working in the same place for almost 4 years, which is a <strong>long</strong> time for working in the internet biz.

Things have started to feel stale here, and I started hearing the little voice in my head telling me that it was time to move on.  I've really enjoyed my time there, having had a hand in hiring pretty much all the guys I've worked closely with all this time.  It's nice to be starting some new stuff, but it's sad that I won't be doing it in the place where I am now.
