title: Rallyhat.com -- Now live!

<p>My side project is <a href='http://rallyhat.com'>Rallyhat</a>, an idea I've had for some time now.  Basically, it's a digital photo scavenger hunt with a nice social networking twist.  I have a teaser page up right now where you can submit your email address to be notified of when a beta is ready to be used.</p>
<p>
It's built using Ruby on Rails.  Why Rails?  Well, aside from all my soul-searching about what to use, there is a simple reason:  I could build it in PHP quite easily, but where's the challenge in that?  All my side projects teach me something and I'm confident I'll come out of this as a kick-ass Rails developer, along with learning some techniques I can apply to my PHP programming.
