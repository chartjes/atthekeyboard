title: Friday Night With The Wife
---
I'm sitting here watching the Blue Jays game with my wife and a commerical for "Ant Bully" (a new animated movie this is, oddly enough, about ants) comes on.

My wife: "Haven't there been enough ant movies lately?"
Me: "Why are you such a hater?"

Ah, wedded bliss.
