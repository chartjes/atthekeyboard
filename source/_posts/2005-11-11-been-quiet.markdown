title: Been Quiet

Things have been slow...baby has been very fussy at night so I'm lacking the energy to post lately.  However, I have been thinking about my latest programming challenge.  At work, it's unit tests.  Which I'm a fan of because it lets me prove that the stuff I just wrote isn't horribly broken.

I am also roughing out the specs for stat tracking for my <a href="//www.littlehart.net/attheballpark"">other site</a>, using some interesting techniques:  post via javascript on a remote site, and then passing a bunch of information to a PHP script that does all the parsing of the important data. 

I'm also toying with releasing the code for my blogging engine that I wrote in Rails to the outside world.  I have to work at making it a little more generic before I can do that.  I'll keep you posted...
