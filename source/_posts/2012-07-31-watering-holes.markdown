I'm taking a product research and development course this summer and as 
part of the course I am doing some research into where certain people
I am interested in hang out. As you know, I'm a big proponent of both
automated testing and best practices. I do a lot of very shallow
research via Twitter, but I want to know what places YOU all hang out
in to find out information about things like how to structure your
tests or what sort of practices you think could help you and your
team get better.
