title: Help Vampires
---
My friend <a href="http://slash7.com">Amy Hoy</a> has posted a really good article on her weblog about <a href="http://www.slash7.com/pages/vampires">Help Vampires</a>.  Amy writes in a very unique voice (using humour in a forum where people seem adverse to being funny) and this is no exception.

Also, if you're into Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails, she is becoming a frequent speaker at conventions.  Maybe she does birthday parties and bar mitzvahs too (just kidding, Amy).
