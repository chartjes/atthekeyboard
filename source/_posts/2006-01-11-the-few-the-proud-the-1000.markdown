I got an e-mail the other day from the folks at <a href="http://www.zend.com">Zend</a> informing me that they were going to be certifying their 1000th person very shortly, and as a thank you for being one of the first 1000 Zend Certified Engineers we were given a special grahpic to put on our web site instead of the usual graphic that they recommended using to signify you are Zend Certified.  So I uploaded it to this site and you can see it in the "About The Blogger" section.

I know some people have poo-pooed the certification, but it got me my current job and recommend that anyone who wants to be taken seriously as a PHP developer write the test.  Don't forget to study though. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" />
