title: It's Convention Season!

<p>
Fresh off the middling success of my talk at <a href='http://cakefest.org'>CakeFest 2008</a>, I'll be giving a more expanded version of the talk at <a href='http://www.openwebvancouver.ca/'>Open Web Vancouver 2008</a>, which is being held April 14 and 15, 2008 in Vancouver.  I really enjoyed going out there last year, and this talk is quite different from the last one I gave.  However, I will have to flesh this one out as I will be talking to a crowd that might not necessarily be familiar with CakePHP, or even MVC frameworks as a whole.  The cute slides done by my kids are definitely going to stay in it.
