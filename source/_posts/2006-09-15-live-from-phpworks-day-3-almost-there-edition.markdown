I'm sitting in John Coggeshall's talk about the Zend Framework and ZFApp.  Last night I had a good talk with him about this stuff as he enjoyed my talk and thought I should take a preview look at the code.  Very much like Rails in that he's providing a way to autogenerate the directory structure for a Zend Framework application and provide some cool support modules for it as well.

I missed the first two sessions this morning because I was with my wife checking out a daycare centre where we're going to be putting our youngest child, but I did make it here in time.  But the one session I really wanted to catch was this one so I could hear John's thoughts about the Framework (you can almost hear the capital F when he says it ;) ) and ZFApp.
