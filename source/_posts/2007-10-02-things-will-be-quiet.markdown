title: Things Will Be Quiet...
---
<p>Thinks will be quiet for a while around here as I need to back up my blog and other stuff in order to make way for an upgrade to my <a href="http://www.veggiehost.com">VPS</a> due to a busted Gentoo configuration.  My emerge binary seems to have disappeared and the tech gurus there say a full reinstall is the way to go.  Not sure when I'll get around to the backup, so I'll see ya on the other side...</p>
