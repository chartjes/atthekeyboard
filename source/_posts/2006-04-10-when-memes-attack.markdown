title: When Meme's Attack!
---
I've seen a lot of web-based memes floating around.  My <a href="http://www.lisahartjes.com">sister</a> sends a lot of them to me as well.  So, in that spirit, I present to you my Google Image Meme.

For each question, you are supposed to choose one picture from the first page of the search results on Google Image.  So, here we go:

1) The city (and state) of the town you grew up in.

2) The town where you currently reside.

3) Your first and last name

4) Your grandfather's name

(not really my grandfather <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" /> )

5) Your favourite food
