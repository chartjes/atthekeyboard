I found <a href="http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=81">this page</a> via Digg.  As much as I hate to admit it, I see a bit of myself in Open Source Oliver, in that I always like to try new technologies and the latest versions of things.  I've gotten better because I realize how much time can be wasted trying to implement something that might not fit.

I like to do the research of new stuff to see if it will fit.  And it's almost always an open source tool because my employers didn't want to pay for a commercial one. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" />  I'm sure you've run into pretty much every type of programmer listed there.
