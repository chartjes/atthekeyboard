title: The Programming Environment of the Future
---
<p>While working away I was listening (okay, and peeking once in a while) at the live stream from the announcement from Google about <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">Chrome OS</a>, an operating system they've been working on.  From what I can tell, it's going to be some stripped-down version of Linux with a window manager that runs one thing:  the Chrome browser.
</p>
<p>
Now, while I think a netbook is great for someone like my <a href="http://teachersatrisk.com">mom</a>, or my daughter, I cannot imagine myself doing any sort of serious programming work on one.  Or can I?</p>
<p>So, first of all it looks like <a href="http://www.vim.org"> is a non-starter.  That means I would likely have to use something like </a><a href="https://mozillalabs.com/bespin/">Mozilla Bespin</a> as my editor.  A quick Google search showed me that you can edit remote files using Bespin, so that is a good thing.  But I would miss doing all the system-level things I've grown accustomed too.  Would make it pretty much impossible to do command line testing of code.
</p>
<p>
And what about all my tools for managing databases?  All the web-based database manipulation tools (like <a href="http://phpmyadmin.net">phpMyAdmin</a> or <a href="http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/">phpPgAdmin</a> can probably meet that need.  But then I'm looking at some sort of web-based SSH client to be able to look at things like server configurations or slow query logs.  Again, it's probably doable but is it optimal?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's an interesting thought.  Perhaps I should spend some time trying to see if I could actually be productive using the tools I just mentioned above.
