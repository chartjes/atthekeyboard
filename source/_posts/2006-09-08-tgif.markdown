It's been a very long two weeks for your humble correspondant.  My evenings have been taken up working on a consulting job (that is down to the clean-up of functionality stage and final testing) and with my daughter's last few baseball games and practices before the final tournament this coming Saturday.

I'm also getting ready for my presentation next week at <a href="http://www.phparch.com/works">php|works</a>.  I've been working on the slides on the train and hope that the presentation is well-received.  Anyhow, that's all for now.  I'll post some stuff on Tuesday.
