Phew!  My talk is over and I think it went really well.  I was *so* nervous for the first 5 minutes or so but cruised along nicely.  I even finished with 5 minutes to spare.  I want to thank all the people who came up to me after the talk and told me how they liked it and that I did a good job.  Nothing like a little ego boost to make you come through nicely after a stressful time.

I'm currently in Chrsitan Wenz's talk on using Flash with PHP.  At work, we're creating a flash movie for use on our web sites that interacts with a module I've created to parse the XML stream that Sportsticker sends out.  I think I will send a link to this presentation to our flash guy (who I think could use some tips on interacting with a PHP script via Flash) so he can get a better understanding of what we need to do.
