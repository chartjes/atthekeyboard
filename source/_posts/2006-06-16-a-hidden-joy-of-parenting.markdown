title: A Hidden Joy Of Parenting
---
One of the choices that have to be made when you become a parent is the choice to set aside the ridiculous amounts of time you used to spend on your hobbies and instead, you know, be a responsible parent and play with your kids.  My oldest daughter is almost 7 and is starting to enjoy playing board games.  When I was a kid I spent MANY hours playing board games with my sister and my friends.

So I decided to do a little digging around on eBay to see if some of my favourite games from my childhood were still around to be purchased.  Lo-and-behold I managed to find a copy of <a href="http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=8825557742&ssPageName=ADME:B:EOIBSA:CA:11">Waddington's Game of Dracula</a>, a game that I really enjoyed as a kid and think that Lauryn will like it to.

It's coming from England, so who knows how long it will be.  I'm looking forward to it.
