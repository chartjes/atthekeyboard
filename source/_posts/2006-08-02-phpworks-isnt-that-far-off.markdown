title: php|works Isn't That Far Off...
---
...and I'm busy working on my talk "What can PHP Learn From Ruby On Rails".  I've been spending time on my train ride home putting together my magazine article for php|architect magazine on the same issue.  I've got 1500 of the requisite 4000 words done...and are trying to make sure that I'm staying on topic and creating something I will be happy about.

Anyhow, I've got another week or so to get the article done.  It's always an interesting process for me when writing an important document (whether it's a magazine article or a technical specification) as I often turn in stuff that I'm not happy with when I hand it in, but are happy with it when I actually read it after publication.  Too critical?  Maybe.
