<p>I have a post coming up later this week on some tips and tricks involving CakePHP best practices I've picked up (and had foisted upon me) but for now it's brain dump time:
<ul>
<li>Can the <a href="http://lazyweb.ca">lazyweb</a> tell me where I can find some cool online crime statistics?  I was at a friend's birthday party last Saturday and he suggested a really cool mashup that people searching for houses would be interested in</li>
<li>I'm back to using Komodo instead of vim because, well, vim just couldn't give me the environment I wanted.  What I need is the "here are the files in your project" hanging off the main editing window, syntax checking when I'm typing away, and then show me what files I changed that are going to be checked back into version control.  Komodo does this.  Vim does not.  Well, at least not the way I want it to.</li>
<li>Is it possible for a single incompetent programmer to cost their employer millions of dollars in lost opportunities without actually breaking anything?  I think a lot of managers would go insane if they actually sat down and tracked how the progress of others was held up by a single person.  That "domino" effect could cost a company a lot of money without them actually realizing it.</li>
<li>Big news out of CakePHP-land is that <a href="http://www.mambo-foundation.org">Mambo</a> will be using CakePHP as the core for the next version of Mambo.  Yet another reason to seriously consider CakePHP, if you haven't already</li>
</ul></p>
