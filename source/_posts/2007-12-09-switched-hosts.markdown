title: Switched Hosts
---
<p>If you can read this, I've switched hosts from veggiehosting to slicehost.  While it's nice to support a Canadian company (Veggiehosting is in Toronto), I had been having lots of unexplained problems with my slice.  Slowdowns, unannounced outages, SSH connections taking 30 to 40 seconds to come up.</p>
<p>
So, I'm all setup again and just have to finish pointing all my master DNS entries to the new slice.
