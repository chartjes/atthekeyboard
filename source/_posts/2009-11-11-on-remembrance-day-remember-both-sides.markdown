title: On Remembrance Day, remember both sides
---
<p>
I am of German descent.  Both my parents were born there (although my mother moved away when she was 2, so I don't know if that really counts).  Both my grandfathers were in the German Army - one as an infantry solider, the other as a messenger.  My grandfather (and for that matter, my father) never told me anything about their experiences during World War II.  I do know that my father had his house bombed out three times, and he probably still suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Sydrome as a result of it.  Anyway, about 10 years ago when I was visiting my uncle (my father's eldest brother) he told me a story about my grandfather.
</p>
<p>
My grandfather was unlucky enough to have been part of the German army during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad.</a>  Once the German army had surrendered, all the remaining soldiers were arrested for crimes both real and imagined (according to my uncle, my grandfather was arrested for stealing a loaf of bread) and sent away to labour camps.  My grandfather got sent to Siberia along with a bunch of other prisoners.  They were dumped into a forest, given tools and told to build themselves shelters if they expected to survive.
</p>
<p>
So, while in that prison camp my grandfather learned to speak, read and write Russian.  At some point he discovered that once a year, prisoners who had committed certain crimes could apply for clemency and be allowed to go back home.  Eventually he was able to get his case accepted and was put on a train headed to Berlin.  I believe this was 1953 or 1954, I cannot remember.  Every time the train stopped, all the pardoned prisoners were marched out and every tenth man was sent back on a train going the other way to Siberia.
</p>
<p>
Luckily my grandfather managed to make it all the way back to Berlin and back to his family in Gelsenkirchen.  I cannot being to imagine what his experiences were like, and I can understand why he was probably very reluctant to tell his very young grandson (he died when I was 11) what World War II was like.

<p>
So on this Remembrance Day I will think about my grandfather, Henry Hartjes, and vow to never forget what happened to him.
