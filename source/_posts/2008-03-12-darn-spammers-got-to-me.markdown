title: Darn Spammers Got To Me!
---
<p>
My in-box is filling up with rejection emails from various places because some asshole spammer decided to use my domain name to send their spam.  Trust me, there's only three addresses that send out mail from littlehart.net and HolliscezanneMorse is not one of them.

<p>
My apologies to anyone who's gotten spam from someone claiming to be at the littlehart.net domain.  It isn't me.
