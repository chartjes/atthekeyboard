title: CakeFest Hispania
---
<p>This was *supposed* to be a post about my successes in getting the Rallyhat web service up and running on Google App Engine, but that's not quite done yet.  Instead, I will inform our spanish-speaking CakePHP users (and the more adventurous types who enjoy travel) that the <a href="http://www.cakefest.org">CakeFest</a> site as been updated to announce <a href="http://cakefest.org/users/add">pre-registration</a> and other information about CakeFest #2, which will be held in Buenos Aries, Argentina at the beginning of December.
</p>
<p>
All your favourite people from the CakePHP world will be there, although I might not be able to make it despite Mariano's very convincing IM conversations.  The organizer (the previously-mentioned Mariano) is a great guy, good contributor to the project, and I still like him despite the fact that he is a Windows user in an ocean of Mac fanbois.  Maybe things will work out that I can go, but if you can make the trip it will be one of the most interesting conferences this year.
