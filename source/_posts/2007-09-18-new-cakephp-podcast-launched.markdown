title: New CakePHP Podcast Launched
---
<p>Mad props go out to Jeff Loiselle (aka phishy) for putting together <a href="http://live.cakephp.org">The Show</a>, a CakePHP-specific podcast.  The archive of the first show is up there (Jeff talks to Nate Abele, with a side-order of Garrett Woodworth) and the next show will be broadcast live tomorrow at noon.  Check out the site for more details, and your humble correspondent may try to worm his way into tomorrow's episode that talks about writing console applications, since I am busy extending bake and adding to my interactive testing console.</p>
