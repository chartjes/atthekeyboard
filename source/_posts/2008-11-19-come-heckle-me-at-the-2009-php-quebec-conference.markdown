title: Come Heckle Me At The 2009 PHP Quebec Conference!
---
<p>
I just got word that my proposal to give a version of my "Deployment Is Not A 4-Letter Word" talk has been accepted for <a href="http://conf.phpquebec.com">2009 PHP Quebec Conference</a>.  It's actually within driving distance for me (5 hours) or maybe I can chill and take the train.  Either way, I'll be there from March 4 to March 6, 2009.

It looks like a pretty great conference lineup, so I suggest you check it out and consider coming to Montreal in March.  It's a great city and I've always enjoyed myself every time I've gone.  It will also be nice to see some people I've met before and always more fun to make new friends.
