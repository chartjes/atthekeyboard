title: Web Mockups, With A Hint Of Balsamiq
---
<p>(Disclaimer: after trying out the demo for this application, I discovered I could get a license for it by saying nice things on my blog.  I was ready to fork out the money for it though)</p>
<p>
I cannot be the only one useless at interface design.  I know my buddy and fellow patio-laying-at-my-house-worker <a href="http://lazyweb.ca">Kevin</a> is too.  While checking out <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> I came across this great application called <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Mockups</a>, which is cool AIR app (I use Ed Finkler's so-awesome-I-actually-use-it AIR Twitter client <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a>) for (shocking, I know) doing mockups of things.
</p>
<p>
When I saw this, I said (really) "Holy shit!!!".  And started to play with it.  And quickly realized that for people like me, this is the PERFECT tool for creating mockups of the sites I want to work on.  I agonize over sites when I'm building one from scratch, so much so that I feel the "paralysis from analysis" effect I have heard others talk about.  Don't believe me that it's this cool?  Check this demo out:

To me, the really cool thing is that it is also available as a plugin for some of the most well-known collaboration applications out there:  Confluence, JIRA and Twiki.  For me, the desktop version is just right, as I can take those mockups I create and export them as PNG's that I can then pass onto designers for comments and tweaking.  This is a sign of a developer who is <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html">"done, and gets things smart"</a>.

It costs $79, and for the frustrated programmer who wishes he could better as a designer, this is an amazing tool to add to your toolbox.  Go try it out and give him your money!
