title: Lazyweb Or Die (Digging)
---
<p>This somewhat obscure post is in response to an IM conversation I had today with my friend <a href="http://lazyweb.ca">Kevin</a>, who has been procrastinating heavily on getting that first blog post done.  Well, the gauntlet has been thrown down.  Kevin is coming to my place next Saturday to help me dig and secure a really awesome swing set that my kids have been playing on in the backyard for almost a year.  He has promised to blog before Patio Day (we're doing  the patio in my backyard as well) or else he's doing ALL THE WORK HIMSELF.  Good luck Kevin...hope you bring a good shovel!
