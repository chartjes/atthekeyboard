Yesterday I gave a short talk at [GPUG](https://twitter.com/_GPUG_) about a topic I've dubbed
"metatesting". Borrowing the phrase from a [children's card game](http://magic.wizards.com)
I wanted to talk about the state of testing and associated tools.

While giving the talk I noticed I was a little rusty in my delivery. I've only
spoken twice in the past 12 months but I think I have the makings of another
solid talk based on what I did here.

Enjoy the video!
