<p>For those who might not look at the same obscure blogs that I do, I thought I should mention that the last few spaces for the first <a href="http://debuggable.com/posts/cakephp-workshop-in-raleigh-nc-sep-6-to-7:488a234d-39fc-4d06-9c57-65aa4834cda3">CakePHP Workshop</a> in Raleigh, NC are filling up so if you want to learn CakePHP straight from the people who help to build it, this is your best bet.  Sadly, I will not be in attendance. ;)  If they hold one closer to Toronto I'll probably come out.
