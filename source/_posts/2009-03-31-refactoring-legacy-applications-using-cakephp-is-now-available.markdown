title: \"Refactoring Legacy Applications Using CakePHP\" is now available!
---
<p>Can you believe it?  My book is done and available for you to purchase.  Visit the <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/book">site for the book</a> for more details.</p>
<p>
When I started working on this book I did have an idea of how much, you know, WORK it was actually going to be.  With some help from a few CakePHP gurus I got all my code tight and working the way it was supposed to.  I guess it's only natural that I should be happy with the way things have turned out, but I'm also happy with how my initial concept seems to have played out.

<p>
Guides on how to apply CakePHP (or any framework for that matter) to a real-world problem are few and far between.  That's why I was so sure that a book that showed how to turn an old PHP app into a CakePHP powered one would be a desirable thing.

I hope you enjoy the book and feel free to send me your feedback.  I may not agree with what you have to say, but I do read every comment and email sent to me.
