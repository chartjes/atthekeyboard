title: Non-acid rephlux
---
Since I apparantly have tons of free time, I'm helping out an open source project called <a href="http://rephlux.sourceforge.net">Rephlux</a>.  It's a continuous integration environment built for PHP.  Basically, you write SimpleTest unit tests and Rephlux checks out the code, runs the tests and creates reports for those tests.  Ideally, you run it on a seperate machine and it has RSS feeds that report on errors that it finds.

I'm a big believer in testing your code (always do tests for my new stuff) so this seemed like an interesting project to get involved in.  I've been talking with the creator and have already figured out a few tasks to contribute to the project.  Like <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/r00bstat">r00bstat</a>, I'll keep you posted.
