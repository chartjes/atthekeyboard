title: Live From php|works Day 2 (Keynote edition)
---
<p>
I'm sitting in the keynote on day 2 where Joe Stagner from Microsoft is talking about how to make PHP play nicely with Microsoft's various tools, ranging from IIS to how to talk to Excell.  I don't have any sites that run on IIS but I can imagine that a lot of people are doing  so.

So, while he's talking I'm going over my slides for my presentation.  I'd be lieing if I said I wasn't nervous, but I should be okay once I get going.
