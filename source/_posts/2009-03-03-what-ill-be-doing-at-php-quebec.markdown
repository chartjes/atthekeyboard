title: What I'll Be Doing At PHP Quebec
---
<p>Before I talk about <a href="http://conf.phpquebec.com">PHP Quebec 2009</a> I wanted to let people know that my book will be out March 9th.  $10 for the PDF, $20 for a print copy via the folks at Lulu.  Site for the book should be up sometime before Friday.</p>
<p>
Later today I'll be boarding a train and traveling in style from Toronto to Montreal to attend PHP Quebec 2009, giving an updated version of my "Deployment is not a 4 Letter Word" presentation.  I'm excited as I think I've really cut it down to the essential points AND have made it funny at the same time.  I thought I'd also talk about what sessions I'm planning on attending for sure.  Of course, this may change for a variety of reasons but it's a good map of where I will be if you are trying to hunt me down and lay a beating on me or something.</p>
<p>
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Practical Zend Framework Jutsu with Dojo".  I've wondered what Dojo is, so hopefully MWOP can tell me</li>
<li>"Building RIA Applications in PHP". John Coggeshall seems to be doing lots of work with (something not PHP) talking to PHP, so it will be interesting to get his thoughts on building RIA's</li>
<li>"Stupid Browser Tricks".  I'm interested in seeing how Sean Coates uses <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo/">Komodo</a> and Firebug</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h3>Thursday</h3>
<ul>
<li>My own talk is at 9:55, so I will probably be chilling out until then</li>
<li>I want to see Andrei Zmievski's "VIM for (PHP) Progammers" talk to pick up a few more hints that can make my own use of the One True Editor better</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<h3>Friday</h3>
</ul><ul>
<li>"Building PHP Powered Android Applications".  I want an Android phone, as soon as I can get an unlocked one in Canada for a price that does not make me swear.</li>
<li>"eZ Components' Mvc Tools".  Derick Rethans is a goddamned superstar programmer, so I want to see  what he's been up to with eZ Components.  You never know, it might be a great fit for work since I grow weary of Code Igniter's DIY tendencies.</li>
<li>I'm going to sit in on the "Framework Comparison" session, but I dunno if I will get dragged into it to try and fight the good fight for CakePHP.</li>
<li>I will catch Chris Shifflet's closing talk and then it will be time for me to head back to Toronto on the train.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
If you're going to be there, don't hesitate to come up to me and introduce yourself.  I don't bite, I'm usually decent company, and enjoy an alcoholic beverage or two...
