title: What's In Chris' Brain, March 2007 Edition
---
<p>Not a whole lot going on.  I joined the <a href="http://www.blackberry.net">crackberry</a> cult today, as my work got me a Blackberry.  It's a very nice little tool, and I look forward to customizing it a little more.  I've already added in a GMail tool so I can check GMail if I'm away from the computer for an extended period.  Anyways, onto what's in Chris' brain.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rallyhat.com">Rallyhat</a> is sitting there doing nothing.  No time.  *sigh*.  Maybe I'll move my baseball blog over to it.  Want to do *something* with that domain.</li>
<li>My <a href="http://www.teachersatrisk.com">mother</a> wants me to do a random posts sidebar widget for her blog (she uses <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>) as a birthday present.  Is she totally wired in or what?</li>
<li>Interactive console for CakePHP is moving forwards, albeit at a very slow pace.  Added in a token parsing loop, but not totally tested.  I'm really resisting simply cut-and-pasting the shell example I took from <a href="http://www.phpontrax.com/">PHP on Trax</a>, preferring to actually *gasp* understand how their interactive shell works.  It's about 400 lines of code I'm looking at, and hoping to chop it down.</li>
<li>I have a hard deadline of April 1 to get the new <a href="http://www.ibl.org">IBL</a> site up and running.  I'm about a week behind.  So, that is at the top of the queue, followed by the widget for my mom and then pounding out that shell.  I really would like to have that shell done for my talk in May, as a cool tool that has been "ported" from the Rails world over to PHP</li>
</ul></p>
