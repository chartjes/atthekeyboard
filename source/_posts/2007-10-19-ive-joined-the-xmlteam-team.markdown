title: I've Joined The XMLTeam Team
---
<p>Like I said in a previous post, I'm never out of work for too long these days.  Besides, it makes the wife nervous about our ability to pay the mortgage if I sit around the house in grubby clothes not doing anything of substance.  Starting Monday I will be working with the folks from <a href="http://www.xmlteam.com">XMLTeam</a> from the comfort of my basement lair, doing programming work for them.  Yes, another telecommuting job.  Better to be lucky than good. :)</p>
<p>
So why am I working for them?  Besides the opportunity to continue working from home, they are in the sports data business.  They provide data feeds, in XML format using the <a href="http://www.sportsml.org">SportsML</a> standard, and have some pretty impressive clients on board (many subscription-based clients) and some of the upcoming projects sound exciting (two pretty cool baseball-related things).  Since I'm a baseball freak, this is right up my alley.</p>
<p>Sounds good, right?  Well, not everything is perfect.  They don't use CakePHP. ;).  They preferred <a href='http://www.codeignitor.com'>CodeIgnitor</a> when they needed some framework stuff done.  Not that there is anything wrong with CodeIgnitor, as it has it's place.  My problem is that I can't keep jumping from framework to framework all the time.  My brain gets confused about how to solve things sometimes.
