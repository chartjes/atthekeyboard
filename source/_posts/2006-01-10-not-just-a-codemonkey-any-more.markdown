title: Not Just A Codemonkey Any More
---
In an attempt to round out my otherwise top-notch coding skills I've decided it wouldn't hurt to learn some more advanced HTML and CSS stuff so I can make my pages look purty and stop using tables for layout (yes <a href="//slash7.com"">Amy</a>, I remember what you said).

So, I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059610197X/qid=1136905648/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6744991-8319958?n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">Head First HTML with CSS and XML</a>, which came highly recommended on some blog somewhere.  I guess I should've bookmarked the post or something.  Anyway, it's humourous yet startlingly thorough guide on HTML and CSS and should be enough to get this codemonkey doing fancy, schmancy layouts on both of his blogs.
