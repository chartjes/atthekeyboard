			Your aura colours are overlapped. Your most likely colours are:</p>
						<p align=""center"">Magenta.<br />
			<table width=""350""><tr><td>
				<img src="//www.davesbrain.ca/aura/images/ma_mug.jpg"" width=""100"" height=""80"" alt="""" border=""0"" align=""left"">
				
				Magentas are jesters. They are zany, spontaneous, offbeat, outrageous, physical, innovative, in the here-and-now, inventors, attention-seekers. Sometimes they're loners.				
			</td></tr></table>
							<p align=""center"">Violet.<br />
			<table width=""350""><tr><td>
				<img src="//www.davesbrain.ca/aura/images/vi_mug.jpg"" width=""100"" height=""80"" alt="""" border=""0"" align=""left"">
				
				Violet are the visonaries and the leaders of the spectrum. They are spiritual, driven, motivated, dedicated, responsible, charismatic big-picture-types. They can also be curmedgeons.				
			</td></tr></table>
