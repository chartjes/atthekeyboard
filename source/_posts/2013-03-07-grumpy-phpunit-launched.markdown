After I wrote my [first Leanpub book](http://grumpy-testing.com) I would get
asked all the time on how to use PHPUnit itself. Again, much like the information
I put into the "Grumpy Testing" book, I found lots of shallow information on
how to use PHPUnit itself.

I did some research [30x500 style](http://unicornfree.com/30x500), worked
on my pitch while writing the book, and on March 4th I launched ["The Grumpy Programmer's PHPUnit Cookbook"](http://grumpy-phpunit.com).

This book is a collection of the most common tips and techniques I use myself
to write effective and quick tests for PHP code. If you've ever wondered
how to create mock objects, or wanted to know how to test code that uses
remote API calls, my book will help you.

As my way of saying thank you to those who read my blog, you can use the code
GRUMPYFEED to get $5 off my book for the next week.

As always, I welcome your feedback via email (chartjes@littlehart.net) or
Twitter (@grmpyprogrammer).
