title: "So you find yourself working from home..."

So, you've found yourself suddenly working from home as part of
the massive upheaval CORVID-19 has caused worldwide. I have worked
from home for the past 13 years for a variety of companies so
I feel like I have the "work from home" process working correctly.

Even long-time remote workers like myself are struggling to stay
on track and focussed on work. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. This
is not a normal situation. As always, take care of your mental health
and physical health.

Before I go any further, I want to acknowledge that what I am going
to talk about works for me under my particular set of circumstances.
Lots of this advice will likely work for you too.

### Location 

A dedicated work space is the best thing you can do to build what
I think is the tripod that will support you -- comfort, convenience,
and discipline. When I first started working from home, I worked
from a desk in my unfinished basement. Once I got tired of being cold
all the time, I relocated to my dining room table. We then got our
basement renovated to include a home office, and I worked from there
for 10 years until we moved to our current location. Where I live
right now I have a home office on the main floor.

Now, I realize that this is not viable for everyone. You probably
lack the space for a separate room. If you can't get dedicated space
with a door you can close when you need to concentrate, I suggest
picking a spot where you living and make that where you will work.
When not working, try not to be in that spot unless you have to. Harder
to do if you are not using a laptop, I know.

One of the key coping mechanisms is making sure you can put a clear
separation between work life and home life. Being at home constantly
can make it feel like you never get a break from work, especially if
you are prone to overworking/workaholic tendencies.

### Equipment

There is no special set of equipment that will make you more productive
when working from home. I mean, here is my list of what I use every day:

* Late 2016 13" MacBook Pro (run closed and connected to display)
* Logitech MX Master 2S (with an Apple Magic Mouse as backup)
* Advantage2 LF Kinesis keyboard (to stay out in front of RSI)
* Dell P2715Q display
* Logitech web cam
* Blue Yeti Mic
* Senheiser HD 558 headphones

I think the bare minimum you need for working from home is:

* web cam (built-in is good enough, don't kid yourself)
* headphones

Everything else depends on budget and the context of where you are working.

I work from an IKEA desk using a Herman Miller Aeron chair for Large Humans
that I bought in 2014,
both of them adjusted at the correct height for my particular ergonomics.
I am an Old Man Using A Computer (I turn 49 tomorrow) so I also have fairly
large font sized and the monitor at a height to not make me strain my
neck or my back.

I am one of those people who have never been able to get comfortable working
on a couch or laying in bed. I encourage you to make a choice that is both
comfortable and does not lead to long-term injuries due to poor posture
and having your wrists at an angle that is not good for it.

It took me maybe six months to get back to my normal typing speed when I got
my ergonomic keyboard.

### Communication

This is the hardest part of working remotely. I have worked at places that have
done this well (Mozilla is the best so far) and lots of places where it was not
done well. In my experience, the key to good communication with a remote workforce
is that everyone uses the same communication channels. This means, at minimum

* email
* text-based chat
* video conferencing

Effort also needs to be made to document what was discussed so anyone who could not
be present for anything in those three communication channels can be brought up to
speed.

Every place that I have worked where the decisions made by people caused lots of
friction where because they were made outside of the "company" channels. Making
key decisions during cigarette breaks or after-work dinners is a sure way to make
a large number of your employees angry at your choices.

### Discipline

To be very blunt -- people can find just as many ways to screw around and waste time
in a centrally-located work environment as they can working remotely. If you screw
around long enough in any work environment, you are likely to get fired.

My suggestion is to try and stay focussed on the tasks at hand, and allow yourself
to blow off steam whenever you have completed one of those tasks. Learning how to 
decide what needs to be done for any task is a critical skill you will need, since
remote work is often asynchronous and lacking in real-time answers.

Again, there are no silver bullets or special tools to handle this. Over the years
I have found the book "The Mikado Method" to be very helpful.

### Social Interaction

Again, to be blunt, you are as socially isolated as you want to be when working
remotely. Under normal circumstances you can always go out and maybe work from
a coffee shop or go to a co-working space. In our current COVID-19 situation, 
those are not options that you can choose. I stay in touch with my friends via 
text chats (both group ones online and individual ones) and video chats. I
deliberately choose hobbies that have a very large social part to them. All
of this is to ensure I do not end up feeling isolated and lacking in human
contact. Working from home also allows me to spend time with my family, and
that contact goes a long way towards making sure my mind is focussed on the
important things in my life.

In other words, stay in touch with the people in your life who are important
to you. Even a phone call to a friend can do wonders for your mood at times
where you feel isolated and ignored.

### Make The Right Choices

Obviously during this time you really have no choice -- it's work from home
or don't work at all. Working remotely is not for everyone but it has been
a great fit for me.
