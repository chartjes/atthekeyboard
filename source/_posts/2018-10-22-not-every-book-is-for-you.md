(Author note -- I am trying to do more blogging and less long
Twitter threads.)

Recently I had a very respectful conversation with someone who bought
one of my books (The [PHPUnit Cookbook](https://leanpub.com/grumpy-phpunit))
and is not happy with the book. They have pointed out the things they
don't like and believe are wrong, and finished off one email with the
phrase "sorry if I am coming across as harsh".

In my response I did say that I am not offended by feedback. Some feedback
is helpful. Some is not. All I can control is how I choose to react to
that feedback. Like my mother taught me: we're not losers, we're choosers.

I did finish off the conversation by pointing
out that LeanPub offers a money-back guarantee on all their books. I am not
offended by anyone taking LeanPub up on that offer. I would prefer to
have happy customers rather than ones who felt they wasted their money
on one of my books.

Maybe that book just isn't a good fit for them.
