There's a <a href="http://blogs.phparch.com/mt/?p=106">posting</a> over at Marco Tabini's weblog where he talks about the rough year that he thinks PHP is facing.  It's all related to the PHP 4 to PHP 5 migration that is going on.  And how many people aren't doing it.  Go read it.

As for me, well, I'm running PHP 5.0.4 right now on my laptop and I'm pushing my host to upgrade to PHP 5 as well.  Work is contemplating making the move, and it wouldn't require very much work at all on our port to make the necessary changes to our code base to take advantage of PHP 5's new features (which are a lot more than "better support for objects".
