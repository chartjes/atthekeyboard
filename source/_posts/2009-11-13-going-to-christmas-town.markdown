title: Going To Christmas Town
---
<p>I'm off with the family to visit <a href="http://www.bronners.com/">the world's largest Christmas store</a> and do some cross-border shopping.  See you all on Monday.  I'm sure my mind will be churning about code generation and concurrency all weekend long, much to the dismay of my wife</p>
<p>
I do admire how she has learned to indulge my ramblings about programming when she is not a programmer at all and doesn't really care. ;)
