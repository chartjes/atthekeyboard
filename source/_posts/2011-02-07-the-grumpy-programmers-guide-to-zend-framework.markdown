title: "The Grumpy Programmer's Guide To Zend Framework"
---
<p>I gave a talk on Feb. 7th at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GTA-PHP-User-Group-Toronto/events/16167723/">GTA PHP User Group meeting</a> about my experiences with Zend Framework.  The video is about 30 minutes long, and I answered some questions at the end. You can grab the screencast (me talking and rambling on, but the screencast software was acting all weird with that highlighted pointer thing) <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/GrumpyProgrammersGuideToZendFramework">here</a>.
