title: Want To Write PHP Code in Bermuda?
---
<p>I get emails all the time from recruiters, and I usually politely respond that I'm not interested since I'm usually pretty happy with the job I have.  I recently got one from Jason Squires at <a href="http://www.squiresresources.com">Squires Resources</a> that I thought I should share with my readers.  Please be advised that I am not receiving any sort of compensation from Squires Resources in exchange for putting this information up here.  I just thought people should be aware of the kind of cool opportunities that are out there.
