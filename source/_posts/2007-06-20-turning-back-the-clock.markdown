title: Turning Back The Clock
---
<p>Well, it turned out that there was a database issue with this blog that was causing the huge problems.  As a result I lost the last two posts. No big deal, really.  To sum up what you missed:
<ul>
<li>I moved this server over to a <a href="http://www.veggiehost.com">Veggiehost</a> VPS.  Been happy so far, although you have to configure *everything*</li>
<li>I started a new job working for the <a href="http://www.cakedevelopment.com">Cake Development Corporation</a>, the people behind <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a>.  I'm very excited to get the chance to work from home 100% of the time, contribute to an open source project I believe in, and do the rounds of the conferences as an evangelist for the framework.</li>
</ul><ul>
</ul></p>
