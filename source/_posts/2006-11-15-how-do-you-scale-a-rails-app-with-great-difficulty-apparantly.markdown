title: How Do You Scale A Rails App?  With Great Difficulty Apparantly
---
<p>Being an ADD programmer, I am always looking at the new and shiny to see if I can learn something.  I may have mentioned <a href="http://yarivsblog.com">Yariv Sadan's blog</a> before.  Yariv is a guy who has thrown himself into Erlang, creating all sorts of cool tools to let you build web-based apps in Erlang.  I'll be honest:  Erlang looks wicked cool, but good luck finding someone to host a web app for you.  Maybe that might change.  I'd hate to have to host my cutting edge up on my own co-located server.  Especially when your budget for operations is close to zero.

He has a cool post on <a href="http://yarivsblog.com/articles/2006/07/18/the-adventures-horrors-of-scaling-rails">the problems some people had building a scalable Rails application</a>.  I've wondered how you would actually go about building a Rails app that can scale.  There aren't too many examples out there, and looking at the blog posts that Yariv's blog talks about brings back <sarcasm>fond memories</sarcasm> of my adventures in helping to build an online dating site.

So why do I find this interesting?  Well, it will go a long way towards helping me decide on the super-secret project.  I *know* that PHP can scale if I need it to.  I *know* where to find help on scaling PHP-driven web applications.  I'm worried that I don't know enough about Rails to scale it if it becomes a big success.  But perhaps I'm putting the horse before the cart here.

Either way, it's certainly food for thought.  Of course, none of this will matter if I don't build the damn thing.
