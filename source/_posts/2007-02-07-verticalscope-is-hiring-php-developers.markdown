That's for the intermediate position.  For the junior position, it's the same sort of qualifications but only 2+ years of experience.  You'll be spending your time working with a small group of IT guys who are great at coming up with solutions to difficult problems.  The ability to deploy applications problem-free is critical, as you will see what it's like to deploy applications for users who don't tolerate any downtime or problems with their sites.

We're a very small IT shop (2 programmers, 1 HTML/CSS person, 2 sys admins) so finding a person who has the skills *and* will fit in with our mix of personalities (having a sense of humour is key around here) is critical.  After all, I want to like the people that I work with.</p>

If you think that you are a good fit for us, send your resume to me at chartjes@verticalscope.com with the subject "PHP / MySQL Developer position" and I'll make sure it gets to the right people.
