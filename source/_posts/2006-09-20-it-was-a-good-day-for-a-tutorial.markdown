...until the stuff broke when I moved it into production.  *sigh*.

I was going to post a tutorial on how to get PHP/SWF Charts to work with CakePHP.  Everything is working okay on my iBook, but when I moved it up to the production server the graphs stop working and I get an error that is not reported on my iBook.  CakePHP reports that it's missing some default layout for AJAX, which is weird considering it's exactly the same code running in both environments.  Smarter people than me will tell me the answer, I'm sure.
