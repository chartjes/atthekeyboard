## Could Be Called 'Revenge Of The Comfortable'

Welp, the Surface Book sat on my desk next to my MacBookAir in it's [Henge Dock](https://ca.hengedocks.com/)
and didn't get used beyond Monday. I had some rough times with it that made
me retreat back into the comfortable arms of macOS.

In our [previous post](https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2016/11/18/from-macos-to-win10-part-2)
I mentioned some things I had to take a look at. How did that go?


### Needed an HTTP client similar to [Paw](https://paw.cloud)

Ugh -- nothing I found was similar enough and I also encountered something
that became a recurring theme -- how much work did I want to do in order to
master a skill but using a different tool? The answer was "not much".

That's probably a personal failing but at age 45 I'm not sure how much time
I want to spend remapping those hard-fought memory mapped skills. I'm sure
you are starting to guess what the final conclusion might be.

### Connect To External Monitor And Keyboard

I didn't bother pairing the bluetooth keyboard I'm currently typing on to
the Surface Book, but getting the monitor connected was. Multiple *hours*
spent trying to figure out what the problem was. Was it the drivers? Was it
my old monitor? What the hell was happening here -- mini display port to HDMI
works just fine on my Mac. In the end, it would only work when I used a
mini-display-port-to-VGA connector. It's 2016 and I was highly disappointed.

This then prompted another hour of me searching around looking at monitors
(hey, a 4K one sounds great) to discover it wouldn't work with my current
laptop and *might* not work correctly with a Surface Book (not all apps
scale properly).

### Better Hosts File Management

"Just edit it with Notepad" -- said by people that never used [Gas Mask](http://gas-mask.apponic.com/mac/)

### Battery Life Is Weird

One of the reasons I thought the Surface Book would be enticing is I could
detach the screen and use it as a tablet. That actually worked okay...but I
would run low on battery after about an hour of usage. That is way less than
what my ancient iPad 3 gives me.

I don't really use my laptop much unplugged, but a tablet that has really
poor battery life isn't that great.

### Maybe The Best Change Is No Change

Look, I know people are going to think I'm weak-willed about this. Yes, the Win10
platform has made leaps and bounds. I did find it jarring to use, and I was
actually able to do everything I needed to do at my day job with it. Bash
on Win10 worked great (except for curl not working correctly). Atom was a
more than suitable editor. Firefox works just fine on Win10. I could do
most of what I want to do on Win10. But I would have to relearn a bunch of
tools. I'm not sure I want to do that.

I have to give back the Surface Book when I get back from a work meeting in
Hawaii (yes, sucks to be me) in a few weeks, so the decision is far from over.
One review I read said [don't get it if you have a newish MBP](https://hackernoon.com/a-week-with-the-new-macbook-pro-with-touch-pad-126eebb89ac#.tfcsz7pap) while another felt that Apple had
[built a great machine for hackers](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/the-new-macbook-pro-is-kind-of-great-for-hackers-64c1c577a4d2#.1a7jc5ck3).

Where does this leave someone with a 4-1/2 year old (that's 45 years in
internet time) MacBook Air? Even more confused than before.

I don't need the Touch Bar because my laptop will run in clamshell/lid-closed
mode approximately 99% of the time. What I really wanted was a MacBook
that has 32 GB of RAM. I can't get that right now. But will there be one
available in April? I would be super-pissed if that happened after I bought
a 16GB one.

I'm still more indecisive about it than ever.
