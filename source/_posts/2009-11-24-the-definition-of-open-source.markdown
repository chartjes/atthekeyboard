title: The Definition of Open Source
---
<p>
This has been bugging me all day long
<ul>
<li>You have a project that is licensed under the GPL</li>
<li>and that project is a front-end to act as a web service</li>
<li>that speaks to a database that is populated</li>
<li>by a proprietary product</li>
<li>and you are the biggest user of this open source project</li>
<li>is it really open source?
</li></ul>
</p>
