I'm going to be writing an feature-length article for <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect Magazine</a> on the topic of scaling PHP applications.  It will be more targeted at the beginner/intermediate PHP developer, as I'ms ure the folks at places like Yahoo would have something to say about how to scale PHP stuff. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" />

I'm looking forward to the experience.  I've got about 2-1/2 weeks to crank out the full article.  I have an outline, so at least I know what I'm going to be writing about.  I haven't had to crank anything this big out since, well, high school.  In college I didn't have to take any essay-writing courses. <img src="//www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png"" alt="-)"" />

I'll talk to them about whether or not snippets of the article can appear online in the future.
