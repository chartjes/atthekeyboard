<ul>
<li>Why the heck can't I find any info on reusable views in Code Ignitor so I can quit duplicating code I see all over the place?</li>
<li>Found a cool article on using <a href="http://tech.blog.box.net/2007/06/20/how-to-debug-php-with-vim-and-xdebug-on-linux/">debugging PHP using XDebug in vim</a>.  Sometimes Komodo gets resource hungry and a quick drop into vim usually makes me feel better.</li>
<li>Man, how much time should someone spend refactoring code they've inherited?  Is it really true that people think everyone else's code is ugly and theirs is a paragon a beauty?</li>
<li>Working on the script for a <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/tag/PHP_Abstract">podcast</a> entitled 'Coding Standards Only Matter When Things Go Wrong'</li>
<li>Trying to figure out if I can fit in an opportunity to teach some online courses into my current employment</li>
<li>Rallyhat (my sporting road trip planning site) is actually in the 'designing screens on paper' stage.  Maybe I will scan some notes for showing people in another post</li>
<li>Jeff Griffiths from <a href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState</a> (Hi Jeff!) emailed me to ask me to provide some feedback on using CakePHP with <a href="http://community.activestate.com/products/Komodo">Komodo</a>.  If anyone else is building CakePHP apps with Komodo, let me know how you're making out.</li></ul>
