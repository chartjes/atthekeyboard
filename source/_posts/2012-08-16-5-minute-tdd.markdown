I created a screencast for you. No really, just for *you*.

<script src="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/javascripts/flowplayer-3.2.11.min.js"></script>

<a 
href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/grumpy-testing/5m-TDD.mp4" 
style="display:block;width:800px;height:600px;"
id="player">
</a>
<script language="JavaScript">
flowplayer("player", "http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/assets/flowplayer-3.2.14.swf");
</script>

If you can't view the video because you're on a device that doesn't support flash, or you want
to view it offline later, then
you can view it <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/grumpy-testing/5m-TDD.mp4">here</a>
