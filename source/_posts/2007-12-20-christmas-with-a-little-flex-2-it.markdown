title: Christmas With A Little Flex 2 It
---
<p>
Many thanks to <a href="http://www.riapedia.com/blog/mike">Mike Potter</a> for sending me a copy of O'Reilly's "Programming Flex 2", which had been on my Amazon Wish List.  It will be some light reading over the Christmas holidays.  Thanks Mike!

Now, if I can scrape the money together for a copy of Flex Builder then I can perhaps use a Flex front end for my sporting road-trip planning site...
