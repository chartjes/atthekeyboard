<p>Taken from a discussion with my friend <a href="http://lazyweb.ca">Kevin</a> via IM earlier today (warning, may contain bad language):

Chris Hartjes
if I want that, I can go with Textmate

webslinginfool
true
very true
actually , why dont you use textmate?

Chris Hartjes
I do use it
but you get me looking at that vim stuff

webslinginfool
ahh
a man of weak faith
tsk
tsk
tsk

Chris Hartjes
very weak when it comes to editors

webslinginfool
wait, let me halt construction of your monument
i've never met anyone like you actually

Chris Hartjes
in what way

webslinginfool
editor waffling

Chris Hartjes
yeah, that's pretty rare
I dunno why I'm like that

webslinginfool
i've never even  heard of it
you should totally add an "editors" 
section to your blog and simply detall 
your experiences
oh, and make friends with a bishop

Chris Hartjes
fuck
YOU

webslinginfool
because you'll start a holy war!

Kevin is a <a href ="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> guy, and is always giving me tips (solicited or not) on how to make my vim experience more enjoyable.  A lot of what he gives me *is* useful.  I probably have a vim setup now that will work okay for me, and I did give vim a two-week audition as my main editor a while back.  However, it didn't have the GUI file drawer / file explorer crutch that I've gotten used to.  Besides, I think my arguments about why I use each editor are just lame.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Komodo - got a free license after talking at the Vancover PHP conference last year (please, go to <a href="http://www.openwebvancouver.ca">Open Web Vancouver</a> this year so they can get enough money for me to fly business class ;)), cool editor, nice debugger...but I find it slow and unresponsive at times.</li>
<li>TextMate - one of the first OS-X apps I ever paid for, nice and snappy, great syntax highlighting...but doesn't have the tooltip stuff that Komodo does.  I did find a cool plugin that shows me what files I've modifed in version control right there in the file drawer, but it's not an IDE like Komodo is</li>
<li>vim - very powerful, pretty much does everything I need in an editor...but all those damn commands to remember, and where's my pretty GUI file explorer?!?!</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Those are three of the lamest statements I've come across in my talking to people about the editor I use.  Editors are usually a religious issue amongst developers:  you can pry the one they use every day from their cold, dead hands. </p>
<p>
So, maybe it's time to grow up as a developer and stop switching between editors.  But can I do it?  Yes, I know you're not used to reading my angst-filled posts about what editor to use.  Damnit, why am I so weak on this issue?!?
</p>
<p>
This post is not intended to become a holy war on what editor to use, I'm just expressing my frustration at my inability to decide what to do here.  If I look at it objectively, it's about what tool I would be the most productive in.  The problem is, I can't figure that out...probably because I keep switching all the damn time.
</p>
<p>
Is it fear of commitment?  Fear that I pick the wrong editor for what I need?  I have started branching out into other languages, so my editor needs to support those as well.  All three can do it.  *sigh*
</p>
<p>
Komdo vs. TextMate vs. vim.  Maybe there is no winner, just a loser.  Me.
</p>
<p>
One of the thing the Pragmatic Programmers said (when not trying to get us to buy their books all the time) is to settle on one editor, whatever one that is, and learn ALL it has to offer because you might be surprised what it can do for you.  Flipping back and forth is no way to do that.  More like a delaying tactic from someone who doesn't want to HAVE to pick, maybe?
</p>
<p>
Well folks, that day has come.  I must pick and stick with it for once.  I'll let you guys know at the end of the week what I picked.  Go back to making fun of me in the other posts, okay?
