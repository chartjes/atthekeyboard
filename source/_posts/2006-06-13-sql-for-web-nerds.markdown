title: SQL For Web Nerds
---
I first ran across <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com&/">Philip Greenspun</a> when I found out that AOL had it's own web server (AOLServer) that ran on TCL.  Talk about  different.  He is also a great writer and I came across a new book he is writing (and the chapters are appearing online) called <a title="SQL for Web Nerds" href="http://phillip.greenspun.com/sql/index.html">SQL for Web Nerds</a>

If you work with anything but the most trivial SQL code I suggest you check this manuscript-in-progress for tips on how to make the most of your SQL.

On the open source front, I'm diving back into <a title="Rephlux" href="http://rephlux.sourceforge.net">Rephlux</a> and have to map how all the CVS stuff works so I can add <a title="Subversion" href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> support to it.  Work also continues on the <a title="AudioScrobbler" href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net">AudioScrobbler</a> module for the <a title="Zend Framework" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework.</a>
