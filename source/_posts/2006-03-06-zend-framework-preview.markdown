Well...the folks over at Zend have released an incredibly alpha version of their <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> for the overanxious developer (such as myself) to check out and see if they can get it working.

Well, I grabbed it...and started working on it with my laptop...and I'm disappointed.  Why?  It's not even close to being usable for what most people will use it for, which is database-driven web sites.  Yeah, it's got some really cool web services components that do work, but I want to use it to build the new IBL web site.  The provided documentation is actually incorrect in how you create an instance of any of the database objects, which is disappointing as well.

I'm happy it's out, for sure.  And I await the next version.  Hopefully with working database components.
