title: Article over at tophosts.com

At my <a href="http://www.verticalscope.com">current job</a> we also run a website for information about web hosting called <a href="http://www.tophosts.com">TopHosts</a>.  I did most of the form submission code in the background and integrated <a href="http://htdig.org">ht://Dig</a> with the articles that are up there.  I was asked to contribute a short article on PHP.  So I quickly whipped up <a href="http://www.tophosts.com/articles/002974.html">this article</a>.

Just a quick intro for people who don't know much about PHP.  They've asked me to contribute other articles down the road on the topic of PHP, mainly because the editor of the site liked my article in <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a> magazine.
