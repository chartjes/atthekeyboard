title: Lazyweb Questions - April 2009
---
<p>The book is doing quite well, thanks.  42 copies sold as I type this.  I am going to give away one of my "Framework Apocalypse" t-shirts to one lucky random customer when I get to 100.  Feedback has been great, so spread the word about the book!  As <a href="http://www.psuedocoder.com">Matt Curry</a> pointed out in his <a href="http://www.pseudocoder.com/archives/2009/04/08/review-refactoring-legacy-applications-using-cakephp/">review of my book</a>, don't let the name fool you.  It could've been subtitled "how to think like a CakePHP developer".
</p>
<p>
So, I have a few questions for the lazyweb (aka my awesome readers).  I'm hoping they can point me in the right direction.:
<ul>
<li>At work, my boss is wondering if there is a way for us to determine *ahead* of time if queries being generated by our web service are going to really churn the database and lock things up.  Since the queries are very dynamic, I can only do so much in the caching department.  Application is PHP-based, built using Code Igniter</li>
<li>Inspired by <a href="http://twitter.com/jperras">my friend Joel</a> feel free to share your essential <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a> plugins.  Mine are <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1075">netrw</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2009">autoclose</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2507">0scan</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39">matchit</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2602">paster</a> (I use it all the time at work), <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697">surround</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273">taglist</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90">vcscommand</a> (although I have started using a git plugin that I can't find the download page for, and then a bunch of syntax highlighting plugins for <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1487">Django</a>, Git, PHP (can't remember which one), Python (can't remember which one) and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=803">Xquery</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Tools for refactoring in other languages look awesome (<a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/09/towelie-keeps-your-code-dry.html">Towelie</a> for Ruby, <a href="http://rope.sourceforge.net/">Rope</a> for Python.  What tools are out there for PHP?
</li>

Let me know via the comments what you know or find out.  Thanks and enjoy the Easter / Passover break!
