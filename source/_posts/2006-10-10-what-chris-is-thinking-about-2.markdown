title: What Chris Is Thinking About
---
I'm just back from a long weekend (Thanksgiving in Canada) and very tired after a weekend where my youngest was sick, and clingy, and not sleeping well.  Such is life.  So, instead of a tutorial I'll have to talk about what I'm thinking about.
<ul>
<li>Have to give a quick demo tomorrow of the code I posted the other day to post things to a vBulletin thread.  The problem?  A lack of baseball-related info coming down the pipe from SportsTicker.  I'll figure something out.</li>
<li>On the advice of my friend <a href="http://slash7.com">Amy</a> I'm going to investigate switching over the IBL site from using Typo to using Mephisto.  I'm having a hell of a time getting it installed though.  Not the best instructions available.</li>
<li>Trying to figure out what to build my super-secret project with:  Rails?  CakePHP?  Roll my own?  Toture myself by following <a href="http://yarivsblog.com">this guy's work</a> and build the site in Erlang.   Tough to decide.</li>
<li>Mourn the potential loss of my iBook to some weird hardware problem...it's in the hands of a MacGenius so we'll see what happens.</li>
<li>Take my iPod in for repairs...for a second time...with the same problems as before...and appearing after the latest iTunes update...and I'm not alone in seeing problems.</li></ul>
