title: The Constant Battle That Goes On In My Head
---
<p>
As I start working on my <a href=http://www.rallyhat.com>super secret project</a> (in true Web 3.14159 style you can't tell anything about it from the domain name) I have to make a decision on what technology to use.  In my case, it's a battle between <a href=http://www.php.net>PHP</a> and <a href=http://www.rubyonrails.com>Ruby on Rails</a>.
</p>
<p>
So what do I do here?  My PHP skills are more advanced than my Rails skills, but I feel like I could easily pick up what I need to know in Rails because, well, programming knowledge of web-based languages is really transferable.  But this project is supposed to be fun at the same time.  I could build it in PHP, but that's not really much of a challenge.  So I'm going to build it in Rails because I'll learn something new by building this application.  In the end, it's all about learning for me.  I've built a simple blog with Rails before, so it will be interesting for me to see if Rails lives up to the "productivity boost" that I (and others) have been claiming.

<p>
I also think I need to go and buy the revised version of the Agile Software Development for Rails book.  Never hurts to have some dead-tree information about Rails.
</p>
<p>
So what is the site about?  Can't tell you quite yet.  I'll be finding some hosting and putting up a splash page shortly.  I happen to think that it will be a very interesting application, and one that will generate a lot of fun for the people who choose to use it.
