title: Switched Servers
---
<p>If you can read this, I've switched servers from <a href="http://www.slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> to <a href=http://www.linode.com">Linode</a>.  I'd had enough of dealing with a Gentoo-based system (all that damn compiling!), and since my friend has always said lots of good things about Linode I decided to move over and try them out.  More resources for less money.  Can't beat that.
</p>
<p>
If you decide to switch over, please use the following <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=18e3668fcd2cde6529636a6d90874236c7f19581">URL when signing up.</a>
</p>
<p>Don't forget, I'm giving a talk on December 6th at 7 PM as part of the GTA PHP User Group meeting at <a href="http://www.longbranchcoworking">Longbranch Co-working</a>.
