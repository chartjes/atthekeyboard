title: Moving on and shooting for the Moon(toast)
---
<p>It's a bit of a bittersweet day here in my basement lair in the frozen wastelands of Kanuckistan.  I put in my two weeks' notice at my job that I'm leaving to go and work with the awesome folks over at <a href="http://moontoast.com">Moontoast</a>, coming on board as Senior PHP Engineer to help them continue to build out their incredibly-awesome social commerce platform.  I will continue to work from home and hopefully get to visit the Moontoast offices in Nashville and Boston. ;)
</p>
<p>
As a result of my leaving, there is an opportunity to work as my replacement at XML Team Solutions.  If you're looking for a telecommuting job where you will be dealing with sports data and using PHP, hit me up at chartjes@littlehart.net using the subject "XML Team Solutions position" and I will forward them on.  Canadian citizens preferred (for tax credit purposes) but the right candidate is the right candidate regardless of location.
