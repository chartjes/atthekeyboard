<p>I got an email this morning from <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a> telling me that my proposal to give my "What PHP Can Learn From Ruby On Rails" has been expected.  My talk is tentatively scheduled for May 17th at 4:00PM.</p>
<p>
For more info check out the <a href="http://hades.phparch.com/ceres/public/tek/page/index.php/schedule">conference schedule</a> to see what else is being offered.  Hope to see you there!
