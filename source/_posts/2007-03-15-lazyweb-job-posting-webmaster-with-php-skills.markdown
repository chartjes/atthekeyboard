title: "Lazyweb Job Posting:  Webmaster with PHP Skills"
---
<p>Do you live near Irvine, CA?  Are you really good at HTML/CSS/Javascript and know some PHP as well?  My employer <a href="http://www.syneron.com">Syneron</a> is looking to hire a webmaster to maintain the corporate web site and probably work on some other projects.  If you're interested, send your resume to me at my work address (chartjes at the company domain.  Figuring this out is a good intelligence test :))
