title: Live From php|works - Interview with Cal Evans
---
<p>
I just wrapped up an interview with Cal Evans over at the Zend Developer Zone where we talked about myself and some of the work I've been doing.  Of interest to him was finding out how things go with our planned implementation of mcluster to work with our network of vBulletin sites.

Cal and I share the same humble beginnings in computers:  we both used to have Commodore VIC 20's!  Wow, that really brings back a lot of memories on my first adventures in programming.  Teaching myself BASIC, typing in programs from Compute magazine.  Ah, the good old days.
