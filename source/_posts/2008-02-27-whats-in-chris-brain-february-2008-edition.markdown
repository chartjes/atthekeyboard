<p>
I'm sitting in the Orlando airport at this ungodly hour waiting for a flight to Memphis as part of an Orlando -> Memphis -> Toronto trip back from my two days at the Newspaper Association of America conference.  I was there with my <a href='http://www.xmlteam.com'>employer</a> to help start promoting the <a href="http://www.sportso.com">project I've been working on</a>.  It was an interesting show, and I had a great time in the booth hanging out and talking with Ken Zajac from <a href="http://sportsnetwork.com">The Sports Network</a> and Digger Turnbull from <a href="http://fantasysports.ca">Fantasy Sports Services</a>.  It was fun huddling around Digger's computer listening to the latest moves during the NHL's trading deadline day.
</p>
<p>Anyway, enough geeking out about my sports fetish.  Work took up a lot of my time this last 2 weeks getting ready for the demo, so my posting has suffered a bit.  Here are some of the things I've been thinking about.:
<ul>
<li>more and more messages about using the CakePHP Auth component on the mailing list</li>
<li>I will be doing some Python work later this week on a utility to rip through some of our archived XML documents at work and do some search-and-replace ninja work.</li>
<li>Investing in using <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> for work has made for some super-quick integration of some new features.  It took me under half-an-hour from the first search in google to get an autocomplete plugin for jQuery working.  Now *that* is rapid development</li>
<li>Despite my best efforts I can't get vim setup and working the way I want.  Sorry Kevin, TextMate is just the best one for me, and Komodo when I need to break out the Xdebug guns</li>
<li>I'm going to put together a post (and contribute the same info to the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org">CakePHP Cookbook</a>) on my experiences with custom pagination usage with Cake, since I had to hack something together for recent changes I've been working on for the <a href="http://www.ibl.org">IBL website</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, enough talking.  It's way too early to do this sort of nonsense (can't believe I have coherent thoughts at 5:30AM) and it's close to boarding time.  See you on the other side...
