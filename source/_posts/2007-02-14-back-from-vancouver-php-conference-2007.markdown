title: Back from Vancouver PHP Conference 2007
---
<p>Looks like I just missed a winter storm that is currently pounding the Greater Toronto Area (Milton is on the outskirts of the GTA) so I may actually be snowed in tomorrow.  Good thing I can work from home when necessary.</p>
<p>
I had a good time in Vancouver at the <a href="http://vancouver.php.net/php_conference">conference</a>, although I really wished I could've stayed for the second day.  I want to thank Shane, Audrey, Peter and all the other organizers for giving me first-class treatment (Audrey, I still owe you that drink).  My talk was really well-attended (much to my surprise as I was up against Ilia and Derek) and I was far less nervous about it than I was when I gave this talk.</p>
I have to thank some of the following speakers:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://gravatonic.com">Andrei</a> for putting up with me, trying to push me to eat that enormous plate of nachos, and for pointing me in the direction of the <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/">Xbox Media Center</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.phpdoc.info">Sean</a> for straightening out some issues surrounding getting paid for a magazine article</li>
<li><a href="http://www.preinheimer.com/">Paul</a> for being in good spirits despite being deathly ill (and being cool about me grabbing a menu from you like an idiot)</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'll be seeing most of these same people in Chicago at php|tek, so that's yet another reason to look forward to the middle of May.  Anyhow, I managed to make a screencast of my talk and chopped it down to size for the blog.  Hope you enjoy it!
