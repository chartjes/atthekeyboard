title: Still No New Code To Report...
---
<p>I've been feeling "meh" this week.  Winding down my last two weeks at my <a href="http://www.verticalscope.com">current job</a> and getting ready to work at my <a href="http://www.syneron.com">new job</a> (by the way, Doron Gerstel, the president of the company, sent me flowers(?!) as his way of welcoming me to the company.).</p>
<p>
So, I thought I'd talk about a few completely random things:
<ul>
<li>My <a href="http://www.lisahartjes.com">sister</a> is doing a webcomic called <a href="http://dominogirls.lisahartjes.com/">Domino Girls</a>.  She's writing, while someone else is doing the artwork.  Trust me, my sister can't draw but she's a pretty good writer</li>
<li><a href="http://cake.insertdesignhere.com/">Nate</a> has been doing a lot of work on some stuff for CakePHP so that my interactive console will actually work.  Once I get my hands on my new laptop (17" MacBook Pro, baby) I'll be able to do more work on that.</li>
<li>I got feedback on the talk I gave at the Vancouver PHP Conference 2007.  It was given a 7.4 out of 10 by those who took the survey.  As I suspected, I was talking too fast and not showing enough PHP-based answers.  Now I know how to chop down the number of slides from the high 50's to the low 40's like I wanted...</li>
<li>The rush is on the get the component <a href="http://derekmartin.ca">Derek</a> and I have been doing for the Zend Framework done.  What's left?  Proper documentation (yay Derek!), remove a deprecated object from our component (Zend_Service_Rest) and replace it with the proper one (Zend_Rest_Client) and then figure out exactly which unit tests need to go and which can stay as there is some confusion about what sort of tests are needed for a totally web-based component.</li>
<li>Saw that the Pragmatic Programmers are publishing a <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/">book about Erlang</a>.  Hrm...for once has my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMan#Powers_and_equipment">spidey sense</a> about technology caught a sniff of something before it hits big time?  Paging <a href="http://yarivsblog.com">Yariv Sadan</a></li>
<li>I'm getting a referral bonus from VerticalScope if the guy they just hired (junior programmer, will be working on <a href="http://www.tophosts.com">TopHosts</a> makes it through his 90 day trial period.</li>
<li>If you like cool war movies, I highly suggest you check out 300, a movie based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, which is based on the real story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae">the Battle of Thermopylae</a>, where 300 Spartan and Thespian warriors held off the Persian Army long enough for the rest of the Greek army to get away, fighting to the death.  I love Wikipedia for things like this.</li>
</ul></p>
