TL;DR: I've started working on [a new book](http://grumpy-phpunit.com).

Having written a book that shows you how to [write code that is testable](http://grumpy-testing.com)
it seemed natural to write a companion book for that, to give people a better
understanding of how to use some of the testing tools.

To that end, I've started working on "The Grumpy Programmer's PHPUnit Cookbook"
to be released in early 2013 (I'm thinking end of January / beginning of February
if everything works out).

The book will be a collection of tips and tricks on how to use the gold standard
of PHP unit testing frameworks, the mighty [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/). If you visit
the [website for the book](http://grumpy-phpunit.com) you can join a mailing list
to be notified when the book is ready.

By joining that mailing list, you will also receive some goodies along the way 
as the book gets written. No, I'm not going to tell you what they are.

The book will be $25. No, I don't know how big it will be. Maybe you will end up paying 
$1 per page, but let's hope not.

The book will also be published through [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com) as I am
110% happy with what they have done for me, and I encourage anyone else who wants
to write their own technical book and keep most of the money from their efforts
to consider using them.
