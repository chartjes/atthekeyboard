title: Sessions update...and some caching
---
After thinking about just what the heck I'd be using sessions for on the <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/attheballpark">other site</a>, I decided to dig around a little and after updating <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> to the latest version (almost 1.0) I figured out how to disable sessions completely.

More importantly, I implemented caching for the user-facing portion of my blog in under a half-hour.  That's right, less than a half-hour.  I sure hope that the new <a href="http://www.zend.com/collaboration">Zend Framework</a> makes things that easy.

A co-worker asked me today if I were freelancing, what would I be using to build new sites.  Without hesitating I told him "Rails.  Unless I couldn't get Rails installed on the server, in which case I'd break out my mad PHP skillz."
