title: Rock-Paper-Scissors 25
---
My oldest daughter likes to play rock-paper-scissors with me, but this is a total another level from that.

<a href="http://www.umop.com/rps25.htm">RPS-25</a>

It's rock-paper-scissors with <strong>25</strong> different hand-gestures!  I'm not even sure I could do some of them myself.  Thanks to <a>BoingBoing</a> for showing me the link via their RSS feed.
