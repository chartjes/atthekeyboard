title: Catfish Redux
---
Well, the first version of the catfish didn't go well.? Lots of errors in IE and other flakiness.? Back to the drawing board and now we have a second version that shows some promise.? I went back to basics, grabbing the example from SitePoint because I was having a brain-disconnect on the other example that was using the Prototype library.

Instead, I seized another opportunity to learn something and decided to use <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a>, a really cool lightweight Javascript library (based on moofx I think).? Right now I'm using it to do a nice fade-in for the graphic but we can expand it to cover other things depending on the demands of the site.

I'll also being using jQuery for a <a href="http://www.mustique-island.com">really cool consulting job I'm doing</a> that requires some Ajaxian goodness.
