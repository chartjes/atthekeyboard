title: Upcoming Git Book
---
<p><a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com">Travis Swicegood</a>, who is now my DBFF (Django Best Friend Forever) is writing a book about <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> entitled <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/03/23/pragmatic-version-control-using-git">Pragmaatic Version Control Using Git</a>.  Nicely done, Travis!</p>
<p>
As someone who has started using git not too long ago, I completely agree with him that the market for such a book is wide open.  Hurry up and get it done!</p>
