I really like browsing through [Uses This](https://usesthis.com) to see what
folks from all sorts of industries use to get the job done. Since they are
unlikely to invite me, here's my own details. I share in hopes of discovering
new tools for doing my job and showing folks who haven't been doing this for
20 years what "professional programmers" use. You might be surprised.

### Who are you, and what do you do?

Monday to Thursday am I working for [Mozilla](https://mozilla.com) as part of
the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) Test Engineering group
where I test web services that Firefox talks to, along with deployment testing
of some internal developer tools and a [generic JSON document store](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto)
that we built ourselves.

On Fridays I continue to work on [Grumpy Learning](https://grumpy-learning.com) stuff.
I'm currently writing a "how to test legacy PHP code" video training course for
a large online education provider and are organizing a personal-development course
called [GrumpyConf](https://grumpy-learning.com/grumpy-conf.php) that will be held
March 22-24, 2018. No new books on the horizon and I currently only appearing at
[phptek 2018](https://tek18.phparch.com) in late May of this year.

If you want me to come speak at your event in the fall, get in touch.

### What hardware do you use?

My main device is a [13-inch 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) with 
16 GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD drive. It runs in closed-mode 99.999% of the time
plugged into a [Dell P2715Q display](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-27-ultra-hd-4k-monitor-p2715q/apd/210-adof/monitors-monitor-accessories) and I use the Apple [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english) and [Magic Mouse 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2). When I travel I bring a [Roost laptop stand](https://www.therooststand.com/) with me. Being a Large Human
using the Roost has made it so I can actually work in environments other than
my configured-for-me home office.

I also make heavy use of an [iPhone 6S Plus](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone6s)
mostly for messaging and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer) use.
I also have a Samsung Chromebook that I can do some PHP web development work on but
it is not powerful enough for the day job. I tried it out to see if it was
suitable as a road laptop for a world where border crossings can quickly
turn ugly. Right now it's not.

I listen to a lot of music (yay [Spotify](https://spotify.com)) and since I
did notice the poor quality of audio from my laptop I splurged and bought
a [DragonFll USB DAC](http://www.audioquest.com/dragonfly-series/) along with
the [Jitterbug USB data and power noise filter](http://www.audioquest.com/jitterbug/jitterbug).
I now have awesome, clean-sounding music coming from my [desktop speakers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KVEIY4E/?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAALxg).

### And what software?

I use macOS (always using the latest stable version of it -- patch your systems people!)
as my development environment and some flavour of Linux (usually [Ubuntu](https://ubumtu.com))
as a deployment environment.

When I am doing [Python](https://python.org) (which is what I use at Mozilla) I am using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
and if I am doing [PHP](https://php.org) I am using [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).
For everything else I am using [Neovim](https://neovim.io). I used to be a Vim-only person
but over the years I have found the value that IDE's provide me to be invaluable.
They have totally-acceptable-to-me Vim bindings anyway.

I make heavy use of the CLI and use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/).

For work I rely on the following tools every single day:

* [IRCCloud](https://irccloud.com) for talking to co-workers
* Mozilla uses Google Mail and Google Calendar, which works nicely with my phone
* [Vidyo](https://vidyo.com) for video conference -- great product, works well
* Firefox web browser. I run the [Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/) version

When I do [my podcast](https://devhell.info) with Ed, I use [Skype](https://skype.com) with
the [Call Recorder](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/) plug in. I send the recording
of my side to him and he fixes it all up.

On my iPhone I use the following apps quite a bit:

* Mail.app
* Mobile Safari
* [Twitterrific](https://twitterrific.com/ios/) (and on macOS too)
* [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) for listening to podcasts

I also use all sorts of other apps (messaging ones mostly) like any long-time
user of an iOS device.

I am a competitive-casual [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com)
player, mostly playing the Legacy format (but with a splash of Vintage
and the random cube or EDH game mixed in). For many years I was frustrated
with my lack of success at the tournament level. I was lucky enough to
fall in with a group of people who made me realize that I actually enjoyed
the social aspect of the game the most. 

### What would be your dream setup?

I've worked from home for 11 years now -- I never want to go back to a
full-time office experience ever again. I'm totally happy with my
computer and my display and all the other tools I use. I tend to upgrade
things incrementally instead of in big shots. I like consistency and
the ability to quickly get back to work when upgrading any of my
equipment.

I hope this helps! Got any more questions or suggestions of things I should
check out. Hit me up on Twitter or via the email link in the sidebar.
