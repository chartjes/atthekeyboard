(I appologize for the cheesy Star Trek quote above).

My beloved iBook gave up the ghost on Sunday night, and is currently in good hands with a man I only know as MacGenius.  It's definitely hardware related as the hard-drive is okay and the diagnostics for the memory and other stuff turned up ok.  Maybe the hard-drive controller.  Anyway, my work very generously replaced my iBook for me with a new MacBook, and boy is it slick. ;)

Anyhow, I'm busy rebuilding all the developer's tools I normally use (Ruby, PHP, MySQL, Postgres) so I can get back to actually Getting Things Done.  Once that is set, then I'll be monkeying around with some changes to Zend_Service_Audioscrobbler.
