title: Sometimes It's Better To Give In
---
Recently I switched my other <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/attheballpark">blog</a> over to using <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">the Typo blog engine</a> instead of the one I had written myself.  It's written in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> as well, so I will be able to go into it and hack around.  First task is to add some captcha stuff to the comments.  

I don't get tons of traffic to that blog, but I hate comment spammers with a passion.  With captcha in there, it will get rid of all but the most hardcore of spammers.  Which is good enough for me.
