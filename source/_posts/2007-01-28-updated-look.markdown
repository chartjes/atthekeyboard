title: Updated Look

<p>While googling around looking for info on using <a href="http://widgets.wordpress.com/">widgets in WordPress</a> I saw a link to an awesome looking theme.  Plus it supports the use of widgets, so I can easily change how the site looks on the sidebar.  Google also pointed me to a widget for the post popularity plugin I'm using, so I haven't missed anything I used to have in the sidebar.  I like the new look:  it's vibrant and cool.
