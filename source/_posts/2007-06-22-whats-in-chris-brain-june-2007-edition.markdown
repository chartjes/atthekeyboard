title: What's In Chris' Brain - June 2007 Edition
---
<p>Well, it's certainly been a very eventful month for your not-so-humble blogger.  Here's what's been ratling around in my brain lately:
<ul>
<li>Finally sent over my contribution to <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/tag/PHP_Abstract">PHP Abstract</a>, the podcast sponsored by Zend and put together by Cal Evans.  I'll be talking about "Opinionated Software" on a future edition of the podcast.  My wife said it was a perfect topic because I'm such an opinionated person.</li>
<li>What stops more people from adopting lightweight web servers like <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net">lighttpd</a> and my current favourite <a href="http://nginx.net">nginx</a> for their PHP setup?  I used to think that mod_php was all that and a bag of chips, but running things via FastCGI seems to be providing me with the kind of performance I like.  I wonder if anyone has done a comparison on how to scale out a PHP site that use php-cgi?</li>
<li>Rallyhat will definitely be a Python site, and I'll be building it with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>.  As my friend <a href="http://lazyweb.ca">Kevin</a> pointed out:  "It's almost like programming in a DSL thanks to all those magic methods in Rails and Django."</li>
<li>Until gwoo and PhpNut from <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> showed me how to get the most of out using <a href="http://cakebaker.42dh.com/tags/bake/">Bake</a> I never understood why it's such a useful tool.  For a current project I've been using bake to build out all sorts of functionality in a fraction of the time it used to take me.  If you do stuff with CakePHP, do yourself a favour and learn how to use bake.</li>
<li>I discovered that I can actually be more productive using vim as my editor for all my PHP work.  Go check out <a href="http://www.gravitonic.com/talks/">Andrei Zmievski's talk on using vim with PHP.</a> Don't fear the command line you OS-X and Linux types!  I never thought I'd like using vim but I've learned to work with it.</li>
<li>I should be getting my new MacBook Pro in the first week of July.  Of all things I miss the most having to work on my 8 year-old PC at home (I'm running Ubuntu Feisty Fawn with E17 as the window manager) I miss <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>.  I still find myself typing Ctrl-Space to bring up the program loader.  If you use OS-X check it out.  Once you start using it you'll wonder why you didn't use it before.</li>
</ul>
