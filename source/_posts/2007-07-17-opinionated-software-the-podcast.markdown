title: Opinionated Software, The Podcast
---
<p>A while back I was contacted by Cal Evans over at the <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">Zend Developer Zone</a> to contribute to a new podcast he was starting up called <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/tag/PHP_Abstract">PHP Abstract</a>.  Very cool idea, a small 5 to 7 minute podcast by PHP developers where they talk about a topic of interest to them (and hoepfully to you).  Well, being one to never miss out on an oppurtinity to promote myself I agreed to contribute what I could.  I settled on a brief talk about <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/2349-PHP-Abstract-Podcast-Episode-11-Opinionated-Software">opinionated software</a>.  Also known as "convention over configuration" by the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> crowd.</p>
<p>
Go over and have a listen and don't be shy in sharing your feedback via the comments there or here.  Opionated software / convention over configuration / tools with rules is a powerful yet misunderstood programming practice.</p>
