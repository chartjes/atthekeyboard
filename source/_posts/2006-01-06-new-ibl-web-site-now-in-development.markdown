title: New IBL web site  now in development
---
Yes, it's finally up and running.  I settled on <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> as the CMS of choice and spent some time hacking together a module to automatically display the latest standings.  It took me about an hour from starting the tutorial to getting it to work.  Right now it's done both as a "block" that's on the side of the page and as a standalone page with expanded information about the standings. Go take a look:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www-dev.ibl.org">main page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www-dev.ibl.org/standings">expanded standings page</a></li>
</ul>
Obviously, there is more work to be done but we've started.
