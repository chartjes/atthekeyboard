title: Useful Tools For Non-Designers

<p>
I've been playing with <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint CSS</a> until such time that I can create grid layouts in CSS myself.  My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/chiggsy">Kevin</a> pointed out an Air app called <a href="http://toki-woki.net/p/Boks/">Boks</a> that lets you create your own layouts, complete with inserting HTML along with it too.  The screencasts are awesome and I highly recommend it to hard-core programmers who need some help with layouts.
