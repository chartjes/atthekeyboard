If you are in the Greater Toronto Area and can make it out to York University's
campus in North York, I will be teaching a [PHP Application Testing Bootcamp course](http://phptesting-estw.eventbrite.ca/)
over three nights: August 13, 20 and 27th. Come out from 8pm to 10pm and push
your PHP and application testing skills to the next level.

Space is limited (15 students), so act fast and I hope to see some of you there!
