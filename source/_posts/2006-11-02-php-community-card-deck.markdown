title: PHP Community Card Deck
---
<p>
A while back Cal Evans (editor of <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">Zend Developer Zone</a>) sent me an email asking me to send him a picture of myself for a community project that he thought would be fun.  Being a huge egomaniac, I sent him probably the best picture of myself my wife has ever taken with our digital camera.  The result?  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/calevans/sets/72157594355906012/">PHP Community Playing Cards</a> deck.  I'll be getting a copy of the deck in the mail from Cal.  I'm the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/calevans/286001179/in/set-72157594355906012/">8 of Diamonds</a> in the deck.

I'll be sure to play Go Fish with my oldest daughter when I get my copy.
