title: "Screencast: Interactive Console for CakePHP"
---
<p>One of the things I've been working on in my (increasingly sparse) free-time is an interactive testing console for CakePHP.  I had suggested in an email to the CakePHP mailing list that an interactive console for doing testing of Models would be good.  While at php|tek I spent a lot of time with the CakePHP guys talking about this.  Out of it came some more ideas (like the ability to test your routes) and they even implemented a console that spits out API information for you.  Very cool stuff.  So, I decided to do a little screencast demo of a very early alpha version of the interactive console.  Hope you like it.
