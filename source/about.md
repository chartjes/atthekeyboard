# About the Author or Blog

Chris Hartjes has been building web applications of all shapes and sizes since 1998, ranging from catalogs of CD compilations for professional DJ's to portal pages for large US cable television providers. Chris gives back to the programming communities that have helped him by mentoring, speaking at conferences, and by co-organizing [TrueNorth PHP](http://truenorthphp.ca). As the author of two books on writing testable PHP code and using testing tools, he believes that testing and automation are secret weapons that organizations can use to deliver high-quality applications quickly. He works from his basement office in the snowy wilds of Canada.
